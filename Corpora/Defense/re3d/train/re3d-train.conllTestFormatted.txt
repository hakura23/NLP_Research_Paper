was
a
military
operation
executed
by
coalition
forces
in
early
November
2005
to
reduce
the
flow
of
foreign
insurgents
crossing
the
border
and
joining
the
Iraqi
insurgency
.

The
hospital
has
facilities
for
MRI
and
CT
scan
,
a
gamma
camera
and
lithotripsy
device
.

The
operation
was
important
in
that
it
was
the
first
large
scale
deployment
of
the
New
Iraqi
Army
.

This
was
my
first
visit
to
Uzbekistan
and
an
important
opportunity
to
deepen
and
strengthen
bilateral
relations
between
the
UK
and
Uzbekistan
on
a
number
of
issues
important
to
us
both
.

The
group
was

And
hopefully
,
by

,
we
can
achieve
this

But
nobody
can
leave
now

The
Members
of
the
Security
Council
are
encouraged
by
the
decision
of
Iraqi
President
Fuad
Masum
to
nominate
a

We
extend
our
deepest
condolences
to

for
a
speedy
recovery
of
all
those
wounded

The
siege
of
Darayya
by
government
and
pro

Assad
forces
began
nearly
four
years
ago
.

"
The
stock
of

his

proudly
sold

just
mounds
of
blackness

said
:

We

our

be
the

They

We
are
consulting
with
the
Government
of
Iraq
to
ascertain
the
full
extent
of
this
unprovoked
attack
.

While
this
important
step
forward
brings
us
closer
to
starting
negotiations
between
the
Syrian
parties
,
we
recognize
the
difficult
work
ahead
,
and
remain
determined
to
continue
toward
a
political
settlement
that
brings
an
end
the
conflict
.

Minister
for
the
Middle
East
,
Tobias
Ellwood
said
:

In
one
of
our
Skype
conversations
,
Anas
tells
me
that
as

The
Defense
Department
has
identified
the
American
service
member
who
was
killed
in
Syria
on
Thanksgiving
Day
.

The
mournful
lament
from
his
cello
wafted
through
the
dark
warren
of
charred
and
gutted
shops
which
now
line
a
street
once
known
for
its
bright
,
blinking
neon
signs
and
shops
selling
everything
from
perfume
to
pretty
dresses
to
kebabs
.

But
Anas
says
it
helps
the
community
in
all
sorts
of
ways
.

In
Syria
,
Coalition
military
forces
conducted
23
strikes
using
attack
,
bomber
,
fighter
and
remotely
piloted
aircraft
against
ISIL
targets
.

In
the
past
24
hours
,
the
U.S.
-
led
coalition
â€™
s
four
airstrikes
delivered
24
munitions
against
ISIL
targets
,
which
include
three
tactical
units
,
a
command
-
and
-
control
node
and
five
supply
routes
in
support
of
SDF
operations
to
isolate
Raqqa
,
Davis
said
.

On
behalf
of
the
men
and
women
of
U.S.
Central
Command
,
I
extend
my
personal
gratitude
and
our
deepest
condolences
to
his
family
,
friends
and
fellow
service
members
.
"

They
'
d
come
to
shop
on
a
festive
night
just
before
the
Muslim
Eid
celebration
.

The
isolation
of
Raqqah
,
when
complete
,
will
liberate
strategically
valuable
terrain
surrounding
Raqqah
and
enable
the
liberation
of
the
city
.

They
remain
integral
to
the
accomplishment
of
our
common
objective
which
is
the
ultimate
defeat
of
Daesh
in
Iraq
and
Syria
.
"

This
independent
investigation
has
concluded
that
the
Asad
regime
has
used
chemical
weapons
against
the
Syrian
people
on
at
least
three
occasions
,
and
that
Daesh
has
used
such
weapons
at
least
once
.

Coalition
nations
which
have
conducted
strikes
in
Syria
include
Australia
,
Bahrain
,
Canada
,
Denmark
,
France
,
Jordan
,
the
Netherlands
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
Turkey
,
United
Arab
Emirates
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
the
United
States
.

We
must
all
act
by
continuing
to
cut
off
its
finance
,
severing
its
access
to
oil
and
stemming
the
flow
of
foreign
fighters
,
in
addition
to
the
military
action
we
are
taking
against
this
evil
ideology
.

U.S.
Army
General
Joseph
Votel
,
commander
,
U.S.
Central
Command
recently
met
with
U.S.
Air
Force
civilian
employees
and
provided
an
overview
of
the
CENTCOM
vision
,
the
current
mission
,
and
strategic
approach
.

The
jihadist
group
also
took
over
a
nearby
military
barracks
during
the
battle
.

"
"
"
It
is
however
hard
to
immediately
verify
all
the
reports
we
are
getting
,
so
the
following
examples
should
be
treated
as
preliminary
and
not
definitive
,
"
"
he
noted
.
"

â€œ
The
CJTF
-
OIR
commanding
general
,
Lt.
Gen.
Stephen
J.
Townsend
,
made
it
clear
during
his
Dec.
14th
press
conference
that
we
would
strike
the
equipment
before
it
posed
a
threat
to
counter
-
ISIL
operations
,
â€?
said
Col.
John
'
J.D.
'
Dorrian
,
the
CJTF
-
OIR
spokesperson
.

Votel
explained
U.S.
Central
Command
â€™
s
top
priorities
:

As
the
second
largest
contributor
to
the
Coalition
military
activities
,
the
UK
has
flown
over
870
missions
,
conducted
over
265
bombing
raids
on
ISIL
targets
,
and
is
now
providing
an
additional
125
soldiers
to
assist
in
Counter
-
IED
training
for
the
Iraqi
Army
helping
them
to
clear
territory
safely
and
return
it
to
local
people
.

He
was
captured
by
Jordanian
71st
Counter
Terrorism
Battalion
with
the
aid
of
Jordanian
intelligence
officers
in
May
2006
,
and
accused
of
being
Abu
Musab
al
-
Zarqawi
'
s
assistant
which
Karbouly
denied
.
[

]
Karbouly
told
the
tribunal
that
he
was
â€œ
innocent
â€?
.

Some
Iraqis
still
insist
their
life
is
here
and
only
here
.

â€œ
On
this
Thanksgiving
,
please
be
thankful
that
there
are
service
members
willing
to
take
up
the
fight
to
protect
our
homeland
from
ISIL
'
s
hateful
and
brutal
ideology
.
â€?

The
report
also
details
the
destruction
of
Syria
â€™
s
cultural
heritage
by
Daesh
.

Yet
like
many
Iraqis
who
returned
after
the
2003
war
toppled
Saddam
Hussein
,
Karim
insists
he
will
stay
.

On
Thursday
,
Dec.
15
,
Coalition
aircraft
from
CJTF
-
OIR
destroyed
14
ISIL
tanks
and
other
equipment
captured
near
Palmyra
,
Syria
.

It
was
worried
they
would
push
down
wages
,
take
jobs
from
Jordanians
and
be
encouraged
to
stay
permanently
,
stirring
up
resentment
.

He
was
primarily
involved
in
the
logistics
of
AQI
'
s
effort
in
Iraq
and
assisted
in
smuggling
weapons
,
money
and
fighters
across
the
Syria
-
Iraq
border
.

In
November
2006
the
Islamic
Association
got
permission
to
build
a
Muslim
Cultural
Center
next
to
the
city
center
.

The
International
Community
must
do
all
it
can
to
pressure
the
Asad
regime
to
lift
sieges
in
place
across
Syria
and
sustain
humanitarian
access
.

The
United
States
strongly
condemns
the
horrific
attacks
today
in
the
towns
of
Jabla
in
the
northwest
province
of
Latakia
,
and
the
port
city
of
Tartus
,
for
which
Da
â€™
esh
has
claimed
responsibility
and
where
more
than
60
civilians
were
killed
and
injured
in
multiple
bombings
that
targeted
bus
stations
and
a
hospital
.

On
January
15
,
2006
,
the
umbrella
organization
known
as
the
Mujahideen
Shura
Council
announced
its
formation
.

For
ISIL
,
this
means
yet
another
military
defeat
in
Iraq
.

In
2006
,
while
meeting
in
the
safehouse
with
his
spiritual
adviser
,
he
was
bombed
and
killed
by
U.S.

led
coalition
aircraft

Another
resident
said
he
had
had
heard
a
missile
whizzing
through
the
air
.

The
power
station
was
commissioned
in
1972
.

U.S.
officials
reported
that
the
operation
killed
139
insurgents
and
took
256
more
prisoners
,
and
considered
it
successful
.

The
Department
of
Defense
announced
today
the
death
of
a
soldier
who
was
supporting
Operation
Inherent
Resolve
.

This
report
makes
clear
that
the
Asad
regime
has
consistently
failed
to
co
-
operate
with
the
investigation
.

UN
human
rights
staff
have
received
reports
of
atrocities
being
committed
by
Islamic
State
militants
as
Iraqi
government
forces
close
in
on
Mosul
.

The
regime
and
its
backers
,
notably
Russia
,
are
inflicting
the
worst
bombardment
seen
yet
on
Aleppo
and
other
towns
and
areas
in
Syria
,
causing
severe
humanitarian
suffering
.

Commenting
on
reports
that
ISIL
forces
have
reached
the
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
at
Palmyra
in
Syria
,
Foreign
Office
Minister
Tobias
Ellwood
said
:

The
Department
,
through
its
Senior
Advisor
for
MEK
Resettlement
,
will
remain
actively
engaged
in
the
international
effort
to
relocate
the
residents
of
Camp
Hurriya
to
safe
,
permanent
locations
as
soon
as
possible
.

Answer
:
Deputy
Secretary
of
State
Tony
Blinken
will
travel
to
Paris
for
tomorrow
â€™
s
multilateral
meeting
,
convened
by
the
French
government
,
to
discuss
efforts
to
resolve
the
crisis
in
Syria
.

â€œ
In
support
of
these
operations
,
the
coalition
in
the
last
24
hours
conducted
10
airstrikes
,
including
strikes
against
both
tactical
units
and
the
oil
infrastructure
that
provides
ISIL
â€™
s
shrinking
financial
support
.
"

Alsumaria

almost
all

its

"
On
5
November
,
Marines
from
3rd
Battalion
,
6th
Marines
and
2nd
Battalion
,
1st
Marines
began
their
assault
on
insurgent
-
held
Karabilah
,
and
had
cleared
the
city
four
days
later
.

â€œ
If
we
don

t
get
there
,
fighters
,
bombers
,
and
airlifters
won
â€™
t
get
there
without
the
tanker
.

The
Foreign
Secretary
joined
the
US
Secretary
of
State
and
international
partners
for
talks
on
the
humanitarian
situation
in
Aleppo
and
across
Syria

ISIL
seized
the
tanks
and
other
military
hardware
from
Tiyas
Military
Airfield
near
Palmyra
,
Syria
,
between
11
-
13
Dec.

-
Ensure
an
effective
posture
.

The
group
carried
out
unspeakable
atrocities
in
Dabiq
,
named
its
English
-
language
magazine
after
the
town
and
claimed
it
would
be
the
site
of
a
final
victory
for
the
so
-
called
caliphate
.

Read
the
summit
documents
on
issues
including
counter
-
terrorism
,
migration
,
defence
and
nuclear
energy
.

This
listing
gives
yet
another
indication
that
Assad
â€™
s
â€œ
war
â€?
on
ISIL
is
a
sham
and
that
he
supports
them
financially
.

I
hope
that
yesterday
â€™
s
agreement
can
contribute
positively
to
this
process
.

Despite
differences
in
language
and
leadership
styles
,
the
two
units
were
able
to
overcome
these
challenges
through
the
use
of
translators
and
linguists
while
weeks
of
using
their
equipment
together
provided
the
right
environment
for
the
teams
to
overcome
any
technical
differences
.

And

,
either
directly
or
through
a

And
on
Sunday
,
members
of
IS
are
reported
to
have
killed
50
former
Iraqi
police
officers
they
had
been
holding
in

Of
course
there
are
many
challenges
ahead
but
the
world
has
taken
a
great
step
forward
to
resolving
the
Syrian
crisis
.

HRW
said
the

controlled
town

south
of

been
filled
with

it

by
an
explosion
.

It
is
used
to
train
students
and
graduate
doctors
from
Syrian
universities
and
contributes
to
scientific
research

I
am
deeply
concerned
and
shocked
by
reports
that
ISIL
has
killed
70
members
of
the
Al
Bu
Nimr
tribe
in
Anbar
province
,
Iraq
.

It
also
performs

The
international
community
â€“
including

Iran
â€“
must
now
work
to
support
a
nationwide
Cessation
of
Hostilities
to
help
create
the
environment
for
a
political
settlement
based
on
genuine
transition

The

But
nine

And
reading
has
definitely
made
mine
stronger
.

Recent
media
reports
have
speculated
on
the
role
that
international
forces
will
play
in
the
Iraqi
operation
to
liberate
Mosul
.

She
already
held
a
first
round
of
talks
with
the
Foreign
Ministers
of
Iran
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
Emirates
,
Turkey
,
Lebanon
,
Egypt
,
Jordan
,
Qatar
before
the
end
of
the
year
.

"
"
"
Now
these
people
live
in
dignity
,
"
"
he
says
.

Through
its
illicit
oil
operations
and
trafficking
in
looted
archaeological
material
from
Syria
and
Iraq
,
ISIL
has
generated
millions
of
dollars
in
hard
currency
,
enabling
it
to
brutalize
and
oppress
innocent
civilians
.

Question
:
Will
the
United
States
participate
in
the
Paris
meeting
on
Syria
on
October
27
,
who
will
attend
/
at
what
level
,
what
other
details
can
we
provide
,
etc
.
?

They
go
to
the
market
.

The
fortified
city
fell
to
coalition
forces
after
seven
days
of
fighting
,
bringing
a
conclusion
to
Operation
Steel
Curtain
.

As
we
have
repeatedly
made
clear
,
the
United
States
supports
Iraqi
unity
and
sovereignty
.

The
campaign
began
in
October
,
but
got
off
to
a
slow
start
in
the
face
of
tough
IS
defence
and
counter
-
attacks
.

They
kidnapped
and
killed
11
people
,
including
one
hostage
who
was
beheaded
.

He
came
to
Karrada
to
play
his
cello
,
a
300
-
year
-
old
instrument
he
cradled
carefully
as
crowds
gathered
.

This
meeting
will
be
an
opportunity
for
Coalition
partners
to
discuss
ongoing
efforts
for
Mosul
and
Raqqah
and
to
explore
ways
to
further
accelerate
the
campaign
against
Da
â€™
esh
in
Iraq
and
Syria
and
its
network
outside
those
geographic
borders
.

They
saved
us
from
having
to
bring
in
migrant
labourers
from
abroad
.

As
a
long
-
time
Ally
,
the
United
States
remains
steadfast
in
support
of
Turkey
â€™
s
democratically
elected
government
and
institutions
â€”
institutions
enshrined
in
Turkey
â€™
s
constitution
.

The
attack
was
a
horrific
act
of
terror
against
innocent
people
in
the
early
hours
of
Sunday
morning
in
Karrada
,
Baghdad
.

It
also
serves
to
produce
hydroelectric
power
and
flood
control
â€“
although
the
later
has
become
less
critical
with
the
construction
of
the
Mosul
Dam
upstream
and
several
other
large
dams
in
Turkey
.

The
equipment
was
destroyed
in
the
vicinity
of
the
airfield
,
northeast
of
the
city
along
a
highway
.

The
United
States
strongly
condemns
the
barbaric
terrorist
attacks
in
Iraq
today
,
including
one
in
Baghdad
claimed
by
Daesh
that
specifically
targeted
mourners
inside
a
funeral
tent
.

â€œ
I
am
deeply
saddened
by
the
news
on
this
Thanksgiving
Day
that
one
of
our
brave
service
members
has
been
killed
in
Syria
while
protecting
us
from
the
evil
of
ISIL

So
we
can
be
like
that
too
.

The
operation
is
expected
to
take
weeks
,
if
not
months
,
depending
on
how
much
resistance
they
face
from
the
3
,
000
to
5
,
000
militants
believed
to
be
inside
Mosul
.

On
Saturday
,
militants
shot
dead
three
women
and
three
children
from
Rufaila
,
also
south
of
Mosul
,
because
they
were
trailing
behind
a
group
of
other
people
from
the
same
village
who
were
being
forced
by
IS
to
relocate
to
another
area
.

We
must
keep
pushing
for
a
return
to
a
political
process
with
the
credibility
necessary
for
all
parties
to
commit
to
an
end
to
all
the
fighting
.

Despite
being
captured
by
American
forces
,
Qanbar
was
later
decorated
by
Saddam
for
his
bravery
in
defense
of
the
island
.

After
the
war
,
Qanbar
was
posted
in
Basra
,
but
was
excluded
from
new
commands
after
he
refused
to
stop
the
1991
Shiite
uprising

MR
KIRBY
:
Thanks
,
everybody
.

It
'
s
a
great
way
of
exchanging
ideas
as
well
as
books
.
"
"
"

He
was
a
previous
member
of
the
ISIL
'
s
War
Committee
and
was
involved
in
their
retaking
of
Palmyra
,
Syria
,
before
being
reassigned
to
Tabqa
to
try
to
improve
ISIL
'
s
defenses
against
the
Syrian
Democratic
Forces
.

The
UK
will
continue
to
work
with
the
international
community
to
pursue
an
end
to
the
regime
â€™
s
indiscriminate
bombing
campaign
,
full
and
sustained
humanitarian
access
,
an
immediate
and
lasting
ceasefire
,
and
a
return
to
the
negotiating
table
.

A
Foreign
Office
spokesman
said
:

My
thoughts
are
with
the
family
and
friends
of
those
who
have
been
killed
and
injured
in
such
a
horrific
act
.

This
week
sees
the
start
of
a
second
round
of
talks
in
the
framework
of
the
European
Union
'
s
Regional
Initiative
on
the
future
of
Syria
,
High
Representative
Federica
Mogherini
â€™
s
initiative
to
identify
post
-
conflict
arrangements
for
the
country
.

"
"
Before
we
couldn
'
t
work
outside
easily
.

And
then
there
'
s
the
vast
majority
who
feel
they
have
no
choice
but
to
carry
on
,
no
matter
what
.

In
antiquity
,
the
mountains
were
part
of
the
frontier
region
between
Babylonia
to
the
south
and
Assyria
to
the
north
.

The
Syrian
Democratic
Forces
announced
that
they
began
their
advance
to
isolate
Raqqah
,
Syria
,
Nov.
6
,
2016
.

The
main
purpose
of
the
dam
is
to
divert
floodwater
in
the
Tigris
River
to
Lake
Tharthar
through
the
Tharthar
depression
along
with
irrigation
and
an
84
MW
hydro
-
electricity
station
.

Ultimately
,
the
liberation
of
Raqqah
will
free
Syrians
to
return
to
a
life
free
from
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Levant
atrocities
and
deny
ISIL
a
safe
haven
to
plot
external
attacks
against
the
West
.

I
offer
my
sincere
condolences
to
the
families
and
friends
of
the
victims
,
and
hope
those
injured
in
the
attack
recover
quickly
.

After
being
captured
in
Fialaka
,
he
was
briefly
transferred
to
Saudi
Arabia
before
his
release
.

The
United
States
continues
to
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
Iraqi
people
as
they
confront
ISIL
and
the
violence
it
represents
.

Following
the
meeting
the
Foreign
Secretary
said
:

On
Jan.
10
,
Coalition
military
forces
conducted
23
strikes
against
ISIL
terrorists
in
Syria
and
Iraq
.

The
Coalition
â€™
s
strategy
to
defeat
ISIL
is
succeeding
.

In
April
2015
the
Tharthar
Barrage
was
captured
by
The
Islamic
State
after
several
days
of
fighting
that
saw
120
Iraqi
soldiers
and
a
senior
Iraqi
general
killed
.

The
United
States
strongly
condemns
today
â€™
s
brutal
,
senseless
terrorist
attack
on
Camp
Hurriya
that
killed
and
injured
camp
residents
.

"
"
"
So
,
for
example
,
when
I
have
finished
reading
a
book
I
go
up
to
one
of
the
others
on
the
front
line
and
exchange
it
for
one
he
has
just
read
.

This
realignment
is
partially
designed
to
improve
operations
by
keeping
maintenance
and
operations
teams
together
both
during
the
deployment
and
when
training
at
home
station
.

The
UN
Security
Council
is
clear
that
the
use
of
starvation
of
civilians
as
a
method
of
combat
,
including
the
besiegement
of
populated
areas
,
is
unacceptable
.

We
are
proud
that
the
international
coalition
has
supported
the
Iraqi
Security
Forces
in
its
efforts
to
defeat
ISIL
and
despite
their
propaganda
machine
,
ISIL
are
losing
this
fight
.

Gen
.
Joseph
Votel
,
commander
of
U.S.
Central
Command
said
,
"
We
'
ve
been
very
clear
from
the
outset
of
this
campaign
that
to
defeat
Daesh
we
would
need
to
work
with
many
different
elements
operating
on
the
ground
in
Iraq
and
Syria
.

The
attacks
in
Qamenas
,
Sarmin
and
Talamenes
demonstrate
the
cruel
barbarity
of
the
Asad
regime
in
this
conflict
.

Syria

They
call
him
"
"
the
maestro
"
"
.
"

In
all
five
chapters
of
this
book
,
the
words
of
God
are
given
in
the
first
person
,
in
contrast
to
the
Black
Book
,
which
records
the
acts
of
God
in
the
third
person
.

He
will
also
meet
with
senior
U.S.
military
officials
to
discuss
our
ongoing
support
for
the
Iraqi
Armed
Forces
,
Popular
Mobilization
Forces
,
and
others
in
support
of
the
coalition
campaign
against
Daesh
.

For
the
same
reason
,
it
'
s
long
been
impossible
for
journalists
to
enter
Darayya
,
so
I
have
been
conducting
interviews
by
Skype
-
my
conversations
repeatedly
interrupted
by
shattering
explosions
,
so
loud
that
they
distort
the
studio
'
s
speakers
.

Assad
has
been
utterly
dependent
on
foreign
militias
and
Russian
air
support
,
and
has
caused
destruction
on
a
tragic
scale
including
further
atrocities
against
the
Syrian
people
.

QUESTION
:
Secretary
Kerry
,
did
you
discuss
Aleppo
?

ISIL
has
had
control
of
Mosul
for
two
years
,
and
the
Iraqis
have
cleared
15
to
20
percent
of
the
city
of
enemy
forces
since
the
liberation
of
the
city
began
Oct.
17
,
Davis
said
.

"
We
mourn
the
loss
of
one

,
Navy
Special
Warfare
Operator

H.

who
was

In
the
campaign
to
liberate
the
Iraqi
city
of
Mosul
,
Iraqi
security
forces
have
made
progress
in
liberating
neighborhoods
and
in
clearing
areas
already
liberated
,
he
said
.

The
victims
included
his
nephews
working
in
the
family
'
s
clothing
business
,
together
with
their
wives
and
children
.

I
welcome
the
important
steps
that
have
been
taken
by
Prime
Minister
Abadi
and
his
government
in
recent
weeks
in
support
of
this
,
including
today
â€™
s
announcement
.

"
I
am
delighted
that
FS
Forbin
will
be
operating
as
part
of
CTF

looking

to

contribution
she
will
make

He
'
s
also
set
up
an
art
space
for
young
poets
,
painters
,
and
,
of

musicians
.

The
Israeli
government
has
previously
neither
confirmed
nor
denied
that
it
carries
out
strikes
in
Syria
.

Whether
deliberate
or
accidental
,
this
was
an
indefensible
attack
,
with
at
least
ten
people
killed
and
vital
aid
to
vulnerable
people
destroyed
.

â€œ
They
have
further
linked
the
various
axes
of
advance
into
Mosul
,
which
as
we
â€™
ve
mentioned
previously
makes
the
ISF
â€™
s
job
easier
and
ISIL
â€™
s
job
more
difficult
,
â€?
Cook
said
.

Additionally
in
Iraq
,
Coalition
military
forces
conducted
11
strikes
coordinated
with
and
in
support
of
the
government
of
Iraq
using
attack
,
bomber
,
fighter
,
and
remotely
piloted
aircraft
as
well
as
rocket
artillery
against
ISIL
targets
.

We
have
been
clear
,
defeating
ISIL
will
take
time
and
patience
but
it
is
a
fight
we
must
win
.

"

I
am
appalled
by
reports
of
the
murder
of
hundreds
of
people
,
the
ill
treatment
of
women
and
the
recruitment
of
children
as
young
as
10
as
soldiers
,
executioners
and
suicide
bombers
.

It
is
thought
to
have
bombed
weapons
shipments
intended
for
Lebanon
'
s
Hezbollah
movement
several
times
since
Syria
'
s
civil
war
began
in
2011
.

It
doesn

get
any
more
real
than
this
.

Minister
Tobias
Ellwood
welcomes
new
budget
deal
as
first
step
towards
negotiating
a
solution
to
the
issue
of
federal
budget
allocations

Speaking
nearly
12
months
after
the
fall
of
Mosul
to
ISIL
terrorists
,
Tobias
Ellwood
said
:

It
is
vital
that
all
guarantors
of
the
ceasefire
use
their
influence
to
ensure
it
is
adhered
to
,
and
that
all
parties
take
greater
steps
to
ensure
humanitarian
aid
reaches
all
those
in
need
across
Syria
.

Minister
Tobias
Ellwood
said
:

The
situation
in
Aleppo
remains
dire
with
desperate
images
of
destruction
and
a
flagrant
disregard
for
human
life
being
splashed
across
the
media
on
a
daily
basis
.

â€œ
Of
course
,
the
global
coalition
continues
to
support
Iraqi
forces
with
air
strikes
-
-
eight
in
the
last
24
hours
in
support
of
the
Mosul
operations
-
-
as
well

assistance
from
the
ground
.
â€?

I
was
pleased
to
meet
a
range
of
organisations
to
learn
about
the
important
work
they
do
.

After
specific
legal
requirements
and
policy
considerations
have
been
concluded
,
Iraq
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
this
U.S.

More
than
five

without
access

My
enlightened
brain
has
now
fed
my
soul
too
,
"

he
replies

It
will
include
a
detailed
discussion
on
the
priorities
needed
to
sustain
the
momentum
of
the
campaign

our

lines
of

Our

Russia
has
a
special
responsibility
in
this
regard
to
press
the
regime
to
end
its
offensive
attacks
and
strikes
that
kill
civilians
,
immediately
allow
relief

as
determined

by
the
UN
,
to
reach
all
in

,
and
to
comply
completely
with
the
Cessation
of
Hostilities
,
so
that
political
talks
aimed
at
ending
the
crisis
have
a
chance

Assad

A
series
of
precision
U.S.
airstrikes
against
al
-
Qaida
operatives
this
week
in
northwestern
Syria
â€™
s
Idlib
province
killed
more
than
20
militants
and
destroyed
eight
vehicles
and
nine
structures
,
Pentagon
Press
Secretary
Peter
Cook
told
reporters
today
.

Iraqi
forces
have
seized
full
control
of
Mosul
University
in
their
battle
with
so

called
Islamic
State

said
.

During

call
,
Brig.
Gen.
Richard
'
Tex
'
Coe
,
the
lead
investigating
officer
,
will
present
the
findings
and
recommendations
.

The
information
used
to
compile
the
daily
strike
releases
is
based
on
'
Z

or
Greenwich

The
bridges
were
targeted
by
coalition

in
October
with
the
aim
of
limiting
the
ability
of
IS
to
resupply
or
reinforce
their
positions
in

State

run
Syrian
news
agency
Sana
reported
explosions
at
the
Mezzeh
military
airport
and
said
ambulances
were
rushing
to
the
scene
.

Over
the
last
year
the
Global
Coalition
has
launched
almost
8
,
000
strikes
against
ISIL
in
Iraq
and
Syria
and
have
taken
back
30
%
of
territory
ISIL
once
controlled
in
Iraq
.

The
scenarios
developed
will
include
border
security
,
command

control
,
cyber
defense
and
battlespace
management
.

Many
of
his
comrades
also
have
their
own
mini

,
he
says
,
adding
that
at
just
about
every
defence
point
,
which
are
spaced
about
50m
apart
,
you
will
find
a
collection
of
borrowed

Elite
troops
had
entered
the
compound
on
Friday
as
part
of
a
major
push
into
new
territory
.

For
now
though
,
Omar
says
the
library
is
helping
to
strengthen
the
town
'
s
defences
as
well
as
its
resolve
.

It
is
most
of
all
to
contribute
,
in
coordination
with
others
,
to
a
negotiated
peace
for
a
united
and
democratic
Syria
,
and
to
help
the
Syrian
people
to
rebuild
their
country
once
the
political
conditions
are
in
place
.

â€œ
On
behalf
of
the
Department
of
Defense
,
I
want
to
convey
my
deepest
condolences
to
the
families
of
the
victims
in
Saturday
'
s
cowardly
terrorist
attack
in
Istanbul
,

the
secretary
said
in

The

added
,
â€œ
Please
keep

Mr
Alzoubi
is
convinced
it
is
a
win

situation
.

The
most
recent
airstrikes
bring
the
total
number
of
munitions
in
support
of
the
SDF
since
Dec.
5
to

,
he
added
.

Ambassador
Robert
Ford
has
completed
his
consultations
in
Washington
and
is
returning
to
Syria
.

The
Brandbergen
Mosque
,
officially
the
Islamic
Association
in
Brandbergen
is
a
mosque
located
in
Brandbergen
,
Haninge
Municipality
,
south
of
Stockholm
,
Sweden
.

With
U.S.
support
,
much
of
the

has
been
assessed
and
documented
,
emergency
stabilization
work
has
been
undertaken

and
completed

U.S.
assistance
is
helping
keep
schools
open
for
Syrian
children
;
restoring
access
to
electricity
and
water
infrastructure
;
supporting
independent
media
and
civil
society
to
hold
their
local
governments
accountable
,
and
building
the
capacity
of
the
moderate
opposition
to
play
a
role
in
a
future
Syria
that
respects
human
rights
and
the
rule
of
law
.

The
United
Nations
Security
Council
has
demonstrated
the
unity
of
the
international
community
in
working
to
defeat
ISIL
.

It
â€™
s
essential
that
the
regime
and
its
backers
provide
the
United
Nations
that
access
with
immediate
effect
.

This
is
further
shocking
proof
of
the
horrific
and
indiscriminate
methods
the
Assad
regime
is
using
to
kill
and
injure
innocent
civilians
,
including
children
.

Many
in
Iraq
'
s
National
Symphony
Orchestra
have
already
left

â€œ
This
attack
only
redoubles
our
resolve
to
stand
shoulder
-
to
-
shoulder
with
our
Turkish
allies
in
condemning
these
attacks
and
relentlessly
combating
terrorism
.

At
the
same
time
,
we
are
enormously
grateful
for
the
tremendous
support
provided
by
our
Coalition
partners
,
especially
the
Turks
.

In
addition
to
setting
conditions
for
the
ultimate
liberation
of
Raqqah
,
ISIL
â€™
s
self
-
proclaimed
capital
,
the
operation
will
also
cut
off
militants
from
ISIL
in
Mosul
,
Iraq
.

Last
year
'
s
influx
of
hundreds
of
thousands
to
Europe
partly
resulted
from
cuts
to
food
aid
and
cash
payments
.

On
Monday
,
Dec.
26
,
Abu
Jandal
al
-
Kuwaiti
,
an
ISIL
gang
leader
in
Raqqah
was
struck
and
killed
by
a
coalition
airstrike
near
Tabqa
Dam
,
Syria
.

"
Force
protection
is
my
number
one
priority
here
.
"

Coalition
nations
which
have
conducted
strikes
in
Syria
include
Australia

and

The
Iraqi
military
has
said
it
is
looking
into
the
incident
.

Who
can
say
when
their
paths
will
cross
once
more
or
what
Iraq
will
be
like
then
?

But
significant
gains
along
the
river
may
open
up
western
Mosul
,
which
is
still
under
IS
control
,
to
Iraqi
forces
seeking
to
advance
.

Donors
also
want
to
reduce
dependence
on
handouts
.

The
Secretary
of
State
has
authorized
a
reward
of
up
to
$
5
million
for
information
leading
to
the
significant
disruption
of
the
sale
and

of

for

of

or
to

ISIL

known
by
its
Arabic
acronym
as
DAESH

Tobias

condemns
ISIL
â€™
s
treatment
of
residents
of
Mosul
and
reiterates
the
UK

s
commitment
to
defeating
this
terrorist
organisation

They

also
allegedly
beaten
with
sticks
and
gun
butts

The
UK
,
the
wider
Global
Coalition
and
the
Government
of
Iraq
are
committed
to
defeating
these
terrorists
and
have
already
supported
the
re

by
Iraqi
security
forces
of
over
25
%
of
Iraqi
territory
,
including
Tikrit

â€œ
Working

was
enjoyable

the

These

demonstrate

,
UN
Security
Council
Resolution

,
and
efforts
to
advance
a

With

in

that
has
only
had
access

wouldn

said

In
addition
to
facilitating
access
to
essential

as
Iraq
addresses
multiple
humanitarian

,
the

agreement
bolsters
important
economic

consolidating

Down

,
Denmark
,
France
,
Jordan
,
the

These

that

united

its
condemnation
of

.
Near
Tal

,
three
strikes
destroyed
an
ISIL

and
four
UAV

This
was
one
of
the
most
appalling
incidents
of
the
conflict
so
far
.

With
the
progress
made
in
both
Vienna
and
now
in
Riyadh
,
the
International
Syria
Support
Group
continues
to
build
a
foundation
for
constructive
negotiations
in
January
under
UN
auspices
,
regarding
a
political
transition
in
accordance
with
the
Geneva
Communique
of
2012
.

But
if
implemented
fully
,
the
cessation
can
open
the
way
to
unhindered
and
countrywide
humanitarian
access
to
those
in
need
.
And
,
most
of
all
,
if
successful
it
can
open
the
way
to
a
renewal
of
intra
-
Syrian
talks
under
UN
auspices
,
within
the
framework
set
by
the
UN
Security
Council
.
In
this
respect
,
we
would
welcome
any
intermediate
step
facilitated
by
other
international
players
,
such
as
the
announced
meeting
in
Astana
,
if
fully
inclusive
and
aimed
at
preparing
a
fruitful
and
meaningful
resumption
of
intra

To

Iraqi
military
officials
claim
they
now

eastern
half

As

this

to
meet

Over

Throughout

reiterates
support
for
the
Government

in

fight

To
that
end
,
we
believe
all

should
be
there
with
the
approval
of
and
in
coordination
with
the
Government
of
Iraq
,
under

umbrella

Whilst
this
is
an

it
is
a
positive

first
step

demonstrates
that
both

Ministers
discussed
the
Syria
crisis

That
is
why
the
UK
is
working
as
part
of
the
Global
Coalition
to
degrade
and
defeat
ISIL
in
Syria

,
when

,
striking

In

back
my
life

But
the
young
man
he
met
on

street
years

now
says
he
wants
to
go
.

The
horrific
attacks
in
Paris
have
stiffened
the
resolve
of
the
international
community
in
its
determination
to
defeat
ISIL
,
whose
acts
of
terror
in
Europe
and
the
Middle
East
aim
to
challenge
our
basic
values
and
way
of
life
.

We
put
it
in

to
help
stop
it
being
destroyed
by

The

To
be
honest
I
became
so
obsessed
with
Hamlet
that
I
began
reading
it
at

The
destruction
of
ISIL
targets
in
Syria
and
Iraq
further
limits
the
group
'
s
ability
to
project
terror
and
conduct
operations

ISIL
is
a
threat
to
all
Iraqis
and
it
is
important
that
Iraq
â€™
s
communities
unite
in
the
face
of
this
common
enemy
.

I
am
appalled
by
this
latest
brutal
attack
by

regime
,
just
over
a

after
video
footage

A

that

â€œ
The
ministers
discussed
the
crisis
in
Syria
and
the
increase
in
violence
in
recent
days
,
including
the
recent
unacceptable
attack
on
an
aid
convoy
.

At
the
request
of
DFAT
â€™
s
Middle
East
Branch
,
ODE
has
completed
an
evaluation
examining
the
effectiveness
of
this
response
.

We
have
supported
the
liberation
of
key
towns
in
Northern
Iraq
including
Rabiyah
and
Zumar
,
broken
the
siege
of
the
Yazidis
on
Mount
Sinjar
,
and
pushed
ISIL
out
of
Kobane
.

About
6
,
000
military
personnel
,
including
representatives
from
USCENTCOM
headquarters
and
its
air
,
land
and
maritime
components
,
will
support
the
exercise
.

This
is
also
the
only
way
to
achieve
a
decisive
defeat
of
Daesh
in
Syria
.

"
"
"
There
'
s
huge
suffering
even
among
those
who
work
,
"
"
the
carpenter
says
.

The
Coalition
complies
with
the
Law
of
Armed
Conflict
and
takes
all
feasible
precautions
during
the
planning
and
execution
of
airstrikes
to
reduce
the
risk
of
harm
to
non
-
combatants
.

Although
long
overdue
,
these
supplies
will
help
relieve
the
suffering
of
40
,
000
civilians
besieged
within
the
city
.

Following
the
update
,
the
Foreign
Secretary
Boris
Johnson
said
:

"
"
"
Truly
I
swear
the
library
holds
a
special
place
in
all
our

In

to

two

-
held
buildings
,
two
tactical
vehicles
,
and
an
air
defense
artillery
system
were
also
destroyed
in
the
strike
.

Instead
its
liberation
gives
the
campaign
to
deliver
ISIL
a
lasting
defeat
new
momentum
in
Syria
.

But
he
says
there
'
s
also
much
enthusiasm
for
names
that
are
more
familiar
in
the
West

We

says
Mohammed

Although
the
deterioration
of
the
situation
in
Aleppo
will
be
a
setback
for
the
Syrian
opposition
it
will
not
change
the
fundamentals
of
the
conflict
.

As
Deputy
Secretary
of
State
Antony
Blinken
announced
today
at
the
Manama
Dialogue
,
the
United
States
will
provide
nearly
$
100
million
in
new
assistance
to
the
Syrian
opposition
,
bringing
the
total
support
we
have
committed
and
are
providing
to
the
Syrian
opposition
since
2012
to
nearly
$
500
million
.

They
'
re
the
two
sides
of

you
see
everywhere
you
go
.

The
visit
by
FCO
Minister
Tobias
Ellwood
focused
on
support
to
Syria
as
well
as
regional
security
and
prosperity
.

The
majority
of
their
most
popular
books
are
by
well
-
known
Arab
writers
such
as
the
poet
and
playwright
Ahmed
Shawqi
,
known
as
the
Prince
of
Poets
,
or
Syrian
author
al
-
Tanawi
,
who
chronicled
rebellions
in
the
Arab
world
.

In
Syria
,
Coalition
military
forces
conducted
15
strikes
using
attack
,
bomber
,
fighter
and
remotely
piloted
aircraft
against
ISIL
targets
.

In
their
march
toward
Raqqah
,
the
SDF
has
already
liberated
dozens
of
villages
and
more
than
700
square
miles
of
ISIL

held
terrain

of
a
week
-
long
series
of
simulated
scenarios
to
facilitate
a
coordinated

military
response
to
conventional
and
unconventional
threats
.

The
Coalition
supports
the
SDF
through
training
,
advise
and
assist
operations
,
airstrikes
and
material
support
to
the
SAC
.

This
evaluation
considers
both
the
efficacy
of
material
assistance
provided
and
that
of
Australia
â€™
s
diplomatic
efforts
.

When
a
place
has
been
besieged
for
years
and
hunger
stalks
the
streets
,
you
might
have
thought
people
would
have
little
interest
in
books
.

I
would
say
that
just
like
the
body
needs
food
,
the
soul
needs
books

To
clarify
:

advising
and
assisting

Democratic
Forces
(

,
primarily
Syrian
Arab
forces
operating
in
the

part
of
the
country
who
are
leading
efforts
in

campaign

defeat

We
very
much
fear
that
these
will
not
be
the
last
such
reports
we
receive
of
such
barbaric
acts
by
[
IS
]
,
and
repeat
our
call
on
government
forces
and
their
allies
to
ensure
their
fighters
do
not
take
revenge
on
any
of
the
civilians
who
escape
from
areas
under
IS
control
,
and
treat
all
suspected
IS
fighters
they
capture
in

with
international
humanitarian
law

Karim
and
Sadiq
met
again
this
week
for
another
fleeting
moment
.

It
'
s
also
a
story
about
Iraq
.

The
European
Union
has
been
among
those
calling
for
a
new
cessation
of
hostilities
in
Syria
ever
since
the
last
one
broke
down
in
September
.

Many
Arab
citizens
who
have
been
liberated
from
villages
around
Raqqa
are
seeking
to
join
the
SDF
â€™
s
fight
against
ISIL
,
Davis
said
.

.
Near
Ar
Raqqah
,
five
strikes
engaged
two
ISIL
tactical
units
and
destroyed
a
front
-
end
loader
,
a
VBIED
,
a
fighting
position
,
and
a
tunnel
entrance
.

When
prompted
,
enter
Passcode

.

The
UK
is
at
the
forefront
of
global
efforts
to
provide
humanitarian
aid
having
committed
over
Â£
1
.
1bn
to
vulnerable
and
displaced
people
inside
Syria
and
to
refugees
in
neighbouring
countries
.

Such
a
solution
will
allow
all
parties
to
focus
on
the
shared
threat
posed
by
Da
â€™
esh
and
other
terrorists
.

Also
on
Tuesday
,
a
Russian
military
spokesman
accused
the
US
-
led
coalition
of
killing
more
than
60
civilians
and
injuring
200
others
in
air
strikes
in
and
around
Mosul
over
the
past
three
days
.

Today
,
multiple
attacks
,
also
claimed
by
Da
â€™
esh
,
have
killed
at
least
35
more
innocent
civilians
and
injured
scores
of
others
.

A
Foreign
Office
spokesman
said
:
â€œ
The
Foreign
Secretary
met
Russian
Foreign
Minister
Sergei
Lavrov
earlier
today
on
the
margins
of
the
UNGA
meeting
in
New

,
their
first

-

meeting
since
Boris
Johnson
was
appointed
.

They

.

On
Saturday
,
Dae
â€™
sh
claimed
dual
attacks
in
the
commercial
area
of
the
Al
-
Sinek
neighborhood
in
Baghdad
which
killed
at
least
28
people
.

After
2
years
of
brutal
rule
,
the
people
of
Mosul
can
start
to
have
hope
for
a
better
future
.

Boris
Johnson
met
the
Iraqi
Foreign
Minister
,
Ibrahim
al
-
Jaafari
in
London
today
.

He
survived
the
night
of
the
attack
by
jumping
from
a
window
.

Speaking
today
,
Minister
Ellwood
said
:

The
Members
of
the
Security
Council
urge
all
political
parties
and
their
supporters
to
remain
calm
and
respect
the
political
process
governed
by
the
Constitution
.

The
SDF
have
regained
about
300
square
miles
since
the
isolation
of
Raqqa
began
early
last
month
,
Davis
said
.

"
"
The
salaries
aren
'
t
enough
and
the
United
Nations
isn
'
t
providing
much
.

A
man
whose
sister
was
killed
told
the
campaign
group
that
he
had
heard
a
plane
flying
over
his
home
,
300m
(
984ft
)
from
the
mosque
,
shortly
before
the
blast
.

A
strike
,
as
defined
in
the
CJTF
releases
,
means
one
or
more
kinetic
events
that
occur
in
roughly
the
same
geographic
location
to
produce
a
single
,
sometimes
cumulative
effect
for
that
location
.

Our
position
remains
as
strong
as
ever
â€“
we
will
continue
to
call
for
a
political
transition
to
a
future
in
which
Assad
has
no
part
.

Besides
identifying
common
ground
on
post
-
conflict
arrangements
,
the
initiative
is
examining
the
scope
for
reconciliation
and
reconstruction
once
a
credible
political
transition
is
firmly
under
way
.

Were
there
any
agreements
?

It
remains
unclear
if
the
alleged
bombardment
,
which
caused
fires
,
has
caused
any
casualties
.

The
hospital
contains
645
beds
,
36
of
which
are
for
intensive
care
,
and
has
a
special
emergency
ward

This

is

another
sign
of
Daesh

clear
that
while

it

it

The

demanded

requested
it

to
find
the
perpetrators

At
first
glance
the
idea
of
people
risking
life
and
limb
to
collect
books
for
a
library
seems
bizarre
.

Later
in
the
day
,
Carter
flew
to
visit
U.S.
service
members
at
Qayyarah
Airfield
West
,
also
called

"
The

quoted
as
warning
Israel

"
of

attack

,
according

Reuters
.
"

So
I
sit
there
for
six
or
seven
hours

reading

These
strikes
engaged
three
ISIL
tactical

It
has
suffered
from
a
loss
of
trade
with
its
war
-
torn
neighbours
,
Syria
and
Iraq
and
there
is
high
national
debt
.

Accordingly
,
CJTF
-
OIR
does
not
report
the
number
or
type
of
aircraft
employed
in
a
strike
,
the
number
of
munitions
dropped
in
each
strike
,
or
the
number
of
individual
munition

points
against
a
target

"
"
"
Having
the
new
rules
of
origin
and
having
the
ability
to
employ
Syrians
in
sectors
-
especially
blue
collar
sectors
-
is
very
much
allowing
us
to
convert
this
burden

challenge
into
an
opportunity

ve
got
to

Especially
in
the
wake
of
recent
terrorist
attacks
inside

the

Philip
Hammond
welcomes
UNSC
support
for
new
talks
to
end
Syrian
conflict
.

So
having
a
single
aircraft
deliver
a
single
weapon
against
a
lone
ISIL
vehicle
is
one
strike
,
but
so
is
multiple
aircraft
delivering
dozens
of
weapons
against
a
group
of
buildings
and
vehicles
and
weapon
systems
in
a
compound
,
for
example
,
having
the
cumulative
effect
of
making
that
facility
(
or
facilities
)
harder
or
impossible
to
use
.

During
the
initial
phase
of
isolation
efforts
,
our
Syrian
partners
have
proven
their
ability
in
battle
,
pushing
ISIL
back
and
destroying
ISIL
heavy
weapons
,
vehicles
,
fortifications
,
IED

,

There

Syria
has
for

Cook
said

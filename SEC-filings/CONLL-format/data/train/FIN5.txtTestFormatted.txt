EXHIBIT
A

DESCRIPTION
OF
FACILITIES
-------------------------

The
Dominion
Terminal
Associates
coal
facility
is
sized
to
have
an
annual
throughput
of
approximately
20
million
tons
per
year
.

A
total
ground
storage
capacity
of
approximately
1
.
5
million
tons
is
available
.

The
terminal
pier
and
loading
facilities
are
designed
to
handle
colliers
ranging
in
size
from
20
,
000
to
173
,
000
dwt
.

and
barges
of
varying
sizes
.

The
land
on
which
the
facility
is
located
is
on
the
east
bank
of
the
James
River
in
Newport
News
,
Virginia
.

It
is
bordered
on
the
northwest
by
the
Pier
IX
coal
terminal
and
on
the
southeast
by
the
CSX
Piers
14
and
15
properties
which
are
now
limited
in
use
,
the
primary
business
of
Piers
14
and
15
appearing
to
be
the
leasing
of
the
piers
.

The
deep
water
channel
,
approximately
50
feet
deep
,
borders
the
site
.

Road
access
to
the
facility
is
from
Harbor
Road
,
which
borders
the
south
side
of
the
terminal
site
.

1
.

Railroad
Service
.

The
coal
terminal
facility
is
served
by
CSX
Transportation
,
Inc
.
CSX
brings
loaded
cars
to
the
empty
tracks
.

DTA
moves
the
loaded
cars
from
the
empty
tracks
into
position
for
dumping
and
then
moves
the
cars
back
to
the
empty
tracks
.

.

Material
Handling
System
.

The
material
handling
system
is
designed
so
that
coal
may
be
unloaded
from
the
railroad
hopper
cars
and
transported
by
conveyor
directly
to
the
shiploader
for
depositing
in
the
holds
of
vessels
.

However
,
most
of
the
coal
received
is
transported
to
one
or
two
stacker
/
reclaimers
for
deposit
on
the
ground
storage
piles
.

An
enclosed
tandem
rotary
car
dumper
is
used
to
unload
the
hopper
cars
two
at
a
time
.

The
coal
deposited
in
the
hoppers
beneath
the
dumper
passes
through
a
grizzly
which
prevents
large
foreign
material
from
entering
and
damaging
the
belt
conveying
system
.

Just
prior
to
dumping
,
the
rail
cars
pass
through
a
thaw
shed
which
assists
in
unloading
during
freezing
weather
.

Vibrating
feeders
transfer
the
coal
from
the
receiving
hoppers
to
the
conveyor
belts
and
place
it
on
conveyor
belts
for
elevation
up
above
grade
to
a
1
,
000
-
ton
surge
silo
.

The
surge
silo
is
used
to
increase
unloading
efficiency
by
allowing
the
coal
to
accumulate
while
the
stacker
/
reclaimer
is
moving
from
one
stockpile
to
another
.

A
three
-
stage
"
as
received
"
sampling
system
is
provided
at
the
1
,
000
-
ton
storage
silo
.

While
the
unloading
system
is
in
operation
,
coal
received
may
be
diverted
directly
to
waiting
colliers
or
barges
or
transferred
to
either
of
two
stacker
/
reclaimers
for
stacking
in
stockpiles
.

The
design
rate
for
the
receiving
material
handling
system
is
5
,
200
tons
/
hr
.

The
reclaim
system
provides
for
reclaiming
coal
with
either
or
both
stacker
/
reclaimers
and
a
reclaimer
,
then
conveying
it
to
two
-
4
,
000
ton
surge
silos
located
near
the
pier
.

Reclaim
from
these
surge
silos
goes
directly
to
the
pier
-
mounted
shiploader
for
loading
into
the
holds
of
coal
carriers
.

When
blending
two
different
types
of
coal
is
required
,
the
proper
percentage
of
each
is
withdrawn
from
each
silo
.

An
"
As
Shipped
"
sampling
system
is
located
at
the
tail
end
of
the
conveyor
leading
to
the
shiploader
.

Belt
scales
are
provided
for
both
the
unloading
system
and
the
shiploading
system
to
provide
the
necessary
information
for
managing
the
coal
stockpiles
,
blending
and
as
a
check
against
the
draft
surveyor
'
s
measurement
for
the
coal
being
loaded
in
vessels
.

The
design
rate
for
the
reclaim
handling
system
is
6
,
800
tons
/
hr
.

The
shiploader
and
dock
conveyor
is
rated
at
6
,
500
tons
/
hr
.

The
higher
capacity
takes
into
account
shiploader
shutdowns
for
hatch
changes
.

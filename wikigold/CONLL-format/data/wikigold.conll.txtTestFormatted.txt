the

more
techno-based
than

,
with
heavily
synthesized
songs
like
Introduction

and
Come

XXX
can

This
had
a

meaning
,
and
most
people
did
n't
understand
what
the
song
was
about
.

it
was
later
explained
that
the
song
was
about
Cannabis
(
'
can
of
this
'
sounding
like
Cannabis
when
said
faster
)
it
is
uncertain
if
they
were
told
to
change
the
lyric
like
they
did
on
P.O.P
and
HUMANITY
.

The
139th
was
formed
at
Camp
Howe
,
near
Pittsburgh
,
on
September
1
,
1862
.

Frederick
H.
Collier
was
the
first
colonel
.

After
burying
the
dead
on
the
field
of
Second
Battle
of
Bull
Run
,
the
regiment
was
attached
to
Howe
's
Brigade
of
Couch
's
Division
of
the
IV
Corps
of
the
Army
of
the
Potomac
where
it
replaced
De
Trobriand
's
55th
New
York
,
Gardes
Lafayette
regiment
on
September
11
,
1862
.

The
composition
of
this
brigade
remained
unchanged
from
this
point
until
the
war
's
end
and
included
the
62d
NY
,
93d
PVI
,
98th
PVI
and
the
102d
PVI
.

During
this
time
Couch
's
Division
was
detached
from
the
Army
and
was
occupied
with
guarding
the
fords
on
the
Potomac
.

The
139th
along
with
its
brigade
and
division
spent
the
next
week
marching
from
Poolesville
to
Sandy
Hook
,
Maryland
from
where
on
September
17
,
1862
,
it
was
forced
marched
to
the
Battle
of
Antietam
where
it
was
placed
in
line
of
battle
but
did
not
see
any
significant
combat
.

The
next
day
,
the
regiment
pursued
the
Confederate
army
and
fought
in
a
skirmish
at
Williamsport
.

The
139th
was
transferred
in
October
1862
to
the
VI
Corps
.

In
the
Battle
of
Fredericksburg
,
it
suffered
minor
casualties
from
artillery
fire
,
but
did
n't
get
a
chance
to
fight
.

Five
months
later
,
however
,
it
did
participate
in
the
2nd
Battle
of
Fredericksburg
.

At
the
Battle
of
Gettysburg
in
July
,
it
helped
defend
the
left
flank
of
the
Union
army
.

Throughout
the
spring
and
into
early
summer
of
1864
,
the
139th
fought
in
Grant
's
Overland
Campaign
and
the
early
stages
of
the
Siege
of
Petersburg
.

In
July
,
it
was
transferred
to
Washington
,
D.C.
with
the
rest
of
the
VI
Corps
to
defeat
Lt.
Gen.
Jubal
Early
's
attack
on
the
city
.

Then
they
fought
under
Philip
Sheridan
in
the
Valley
to
ensure
that
no
more
Confederate
armies
would
invade
again
.

(
See
the
article
on
the
campaign
)
.

By
December
1864
,
they
were
back
in
the
siege
lines
of
Petersburg
.

The
139th
supported
Sheridan
in
the
Appomattox
Campaign
and
fought
in
the
Battle
of
Sayler
's
Creek
.

After
the
surrender
at
Appomattox
Courthouse
,
it
was
ordered
to
the
North
Carolina
border
to
support
William
T.
Sherman
,
but
the
Confederate
surrender
there
made
further
support
unnecessary
.

The
regiment
was
mustered
out
June
21
,
1865
.

The
1896
Atlantic
City
rail
crash
occurred
shortly
after
6:30
pm
on
July
30
,
1896
at
a
crossing
just
west
of
Atlantic
City
,
New
Jersey
,
crushing
five
loaded
passenger
coaches
,
killing
50
and
seriously
injuring
approximately
60
.

A
train
consisting
of
seven
cars
left
Atlantic
City
over
the
West
Jersey
Railroad
bearing
a
special
excursion
of
Red
Men
and
their
friends
from
Bridgeton
and
Salem
,
New
Jersey
,
and
had
reached
the
crossing
of
the
Reading
Railroad
when
it
was
struck
by
the
5:40
down
express
train
from
Philadelphia
.

Two
cars
were
demolished
and
the
two
following
cars
were
telescoped
.

The
engine
of
the
Reading
train
was
wrecked
,
the
engineer
killed
,
and
the
fireman
fatally
injured
.

The
car
behind
it
was
thrown
from
the
track
and
many
of
its
occupants
were
killed
or
injured
.

In
1896
,
leaving
Atlantic
City
,
the
tracks
of
the
West
Jersey
Road
ran
parallel
to
those
of
the
Camden
and
Atlantic
until
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
,
when
they
switched
off
to
the
south
,
crossing
the
Reading
Road
at
an
oblique
angle
.

John
Greiner
,
the
engineer
of
the
West
Jersey
train
,
saw
the
Reading
train
approaching
the
crossing
at
a
swift
speed
,
but
as
the
signals
were
open
for
him
to
proceed
on
his
way
,
he
continued
.

His
engine
had
barely
cleared
the
crossing
when
the
locomotive
of
the
Reading
train
,
which
left
Philadelphia
at
5:40
pm
,
struck
the
first
car
full
in
the
centre
,
throwing
it
far
off
the
track
in
a
nearby
ditch
,
and
completely
submerging
it
.

The
second
car
of
the
West
Jersey
train
was
also
carried
into
the
ditch
,
the
third
and
fourth
cars
being
telescoped
.

The
engine
of
the
Reading
train
was
thrown
to
the
other
side
of
the
track
,
carrying
with
it
the
first
coach
.

A
few
minutes
after
the
collision
,
the
boiler
of
the
Reading
locomotive
exploded
,
scalding
several
to
death
and
casting
boiling
spray
over
many
of
the
injured
passengers
.

As
soon
as
the
news
reached
Atlantic
City
it
spread
rapidly
,
and
thousands
of
people
flocked
to
the
scene
.

The
road
leading
to
the
collision
was
a
constant
scene
of
hackney
carriages
,
omnibuses
,
bicycles
,
and
all
kinds
of
vehicles
,
while
thousands
of
pedestrians
hurried
along
the
path
to
render
what
assistance
they
could
or
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
.

Darkness
fell
quickly
,
and
the
work
of
rescuing
the
injured
and
recovering
the
bodies
of
the
dead
was
carried
out
under
the
glare
of
huge
bonfires
.

As
onlookers
watched
through
the
night
,
the
mangled
and
burned
bodies
of
the
dead
were
carried
from
the
wreckage
which
trapped
them
and
laid
side
by
side
on
the
gravel
bank
near
the
track
,
with
no
other
covering
than
the
few
newspapers
gathered
from
the
passengers
.

The
wounded
were
quickly
gathered
together
and
carried
by
train
and
wagon
to
the
Atlantic
City
Hospital
,
where
six
of
them
died
shortly
after
their
arrival
.

Two
others
died
within
a
day
,
with
42
having
been
killed
at
the
collision
scene
.

The
old
Excursion
House
at
the
foot
of
Mississippi
Avenue
was
converted
into
a
morgue
,
and
the
dead
were
taken
there
.

During
the
first
night
after
the
crash
,
the
streets
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Excursion
House
and
the
City
Hospital
,
as
well
as
the
road
leading
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
,
were
packed
with
people
anxious
to
learn
the
latest
news
.

The
Bridgeton
and
Salem
excursionists
who
escaped
injury
were
brought
back
to
Atlantic
City
and
sent
home
on
a
special
train
several
hours
later
in
the
evening
.

James
W.
Hoyt
,
Secretary
of
the
New
Jersey
Department
of
Public
Safety
,
immediately
upon
learning
of
the
extent
of
the
accident
,
telegraphed
for
the
Philadelphia
Medical
Emergency
Corps
,
fifteen
of
whom
responded
,
and
hurried
to
Atlantic
City
on
a
special
train
which
left
Philadelphia
at
10:45
pm
.

These
surgeons
materially
aided
Atlantic
City
's
volunteer
corps
,
which
was
composed
of
almost
every
physician
then
living
in
the
city
.

Many
of
the
injured
were
taken
to
hotels
,
as
the
city
hospitals
soon
became
overcrowded
.

About
thirty
of
the
wounded
had
their
injuries
dressed
and
were
able
to
proceed
on
their
way
.

The
wife
of
Edward
Farr
,
the
Reading
engineer
who
died
while
on
the
job
,
and
was
found
with
one
hand
on
the
throttle
and
the
other
on
the
brake
,
when
informed
of
the
accident
and
of
her
husband
's
death
,
was
unable
to
withstand
the
shock
,
and
fell
to
the
floor
dead
.

County
Coroner
William
McLaughlin
,
immediately
upon
hearing
of
the
accident
,
went
to
the
scene
.

He
went
directly
into
the
block
tower
and
questioned
operator
George
F.
Hauser.
Houser
told
him
that
he
thought
the
excursion
train
had
time
to
cross
the
tracks
of
the
Reading
before
the
express
got
there
and
he
set
the
"
clear
"
signal
for
the
West
Jersey
train
.

(
The
signalling
system
worked
as
follows
:
the
interlocking
block
system
was
used
.

There
were
three
poles
with
semaphores
controlled
by
the
tower
on
the
reading
tracks
and
two
on
the
West
Jersey
.

The
pole
furthest
from
the
tower
on
the
Reading
tracks
was
distant
about
2,000
yards
.

The
other
two
were
much
closer
.

When
the
operator
set
the
"
clear
"
signal
on
the
Pennsylvania
track
,
this
would
automatically
set
the
"
danger
"
signal
on
the
Reading
track
,
and
vice
versa
.
)

Before
Hauser
could
make
a
further
explanation
to
the
coroner
he
received
an
order
from
the
railroad
officials
to
say
nothing
.

He
obeyed
,
and
made
no
further
explanation
.

Pending
an
investigation
,
Hauser
was
put
under
arrest
by
the
coroner
,
but
was
released
on
$500
bond
.

A
jury
was
impanelled
the
following
day
.

Testimony
on
August
4
appeared
to
implicate
the
dead
Reading
Railroad
express
engineer
,
Edward
Farr
.

His
action
in
running
at
a
speed
of
forty-five
miles
an
hour
past
a
danger
signal
seemed
inexplicable
to
those
present
at
the
inquest
.

His
reputation
was
that
of
an
experienced
engineer
and
a
man
of
exceptionally
high
moral
character
,
and
not
of
a
reckless
or
careless
disposition
.

Only
two
weeks
previous
to
the
accident
his
train
was
signalled
to
stop
at
that
very
crossing
,
and
he
promptly
brought
his
train
under
control
.

The
coroner
's
jury
returned
verdicts
on
August
7
.

Six
jurors
merely
stated
the
manner
of
the
passengers
'
deaths
.

Three
found
that
"
Engineer
Edward
D
.

Farr
of
the
Atlantic
City
Railroad
failed
for
have
his
engine
under
proper
control
on
approaching

Hauser
,
in
giving
the
excursion
train

bad
judgment.

[

that
Engineer
John
Greiner
of
said
excursion
train
erred
in
not
exercising
greater
care
on
crossing
ahead
of
said
fast
express
.
"

Three
others
found
that
"
the
cause
of
the
collision
was
the
failure
of
Edward
Farr
,
engineer
of
Train
No.

,
to

heed
in

to
the
semaphore
signals

Milicevic
.

Created
in
1998
by
Jared
Leto
and
his
brother
,
Shannon
,
30
Seconds
to
Mars
began
as
a
small
family
project
.

Things
began
to
speed
up
quickly
,
and
Matt
Wachter
later
joined
the
band
as
bassist
and
keyboard
player
.

After
working
with
small
revolving
door
of
guitarists
(
as
the
band
's
first
two
guitarists
,
Kevin
Drake
and
Solon
Bixler
,
left
the
band
due
to
issues
primarily
related
to
touring
)
,
the
three
auditioned
Tomo
Mili�?ević
to
round
out
the
band
's
roster
.

According
to
an
interview
from
Virgin
Records
,
the

,
the

decided
to

,
the
band
won
the
MTV
Europe
Music
Award
for
"

"
,
one
of
the
two

they

On
December
21st
,
2007
,
30
Seconds
to

won
Fuse
's
Best
of
2007
Award
.

They

over
7
million
votes
.

31
other
bands
and
artists
such
as
Justin
Timberlake
,
Gwen
Stefani
,
Linkin
Park
and
Avenged
Sevenfold
were
also
included
in
the
contest
.

The
band
's
phoenix
logo
(
which
the
band
named
"
Mithra
"
)
bears
the
phrase
"
Provehito
in
Altum
"
,
the
band
's
motto
.

Roughly
translated
from
Latin
,
this
means
"
Launch
forth
into
the
deep
"
;
but
a
more
stylized
version
would
be
"
Rocket
in
(
to
)
High
(
ness
)
"
.

The
logo
was
primarily
used
for
promotion
of
the
band
's
debut
,
whereas
for
A
Beautiful
Lie
,
the
new
Trinity
logo
was
created
consisting
of
three
skulls
,
along
with
the
band
's
name
and
motto
.

The
Echelon
is
a
publicity
street
team
for
the
band
30
Seconds
to
Mars
,
which
helps
in
bringing
friends
to
the
shows
,
phoning
local
radio
stations
to
request
the
band
's
songs
,
putting
up
posters
,
posting
to
band
forums
or
related
bulletin
boards
online
,
and
maintaining
magazines
or
websites
dedicated
to
the
band
.

It
is
also
the
name
of
one
of
their
songs
in
the
album
30
Seconds
to
Mars
.

The
band
made
acoustic
versions
of
songs
from
their
second
album
A
Beautiful
Lie
.

Some
of
the
acoustics
have
been
included
in
some
versions
of
the
album
,
e.g.
Was
it
a
Dream
?
(
Acoustic
)
.

In
addition
to
the
tracks
on
their
two
full-length
releases
thus
far
,
the
band
has
also
recorded
a
few
other
tracks
.

Among
these
tracks
are
"
Phase
1
:
Fortification
"
and
"
Valhalla
"
,
the
latter
of
which
was
present
on
an
early
demo
.

"
Phase
1
:
Fortification
"
was
released
on
an
overseas
single
for
"
Capricorn
(
A
Brand
New
Name
)
"
.

Another
track
featured
on
certain
imported
30
Seconds
to
Mars
titles
is
"
Anarchy
in
Tokyo
"
,
a
song
that
was
recorded
during
the
process
of
their
self-titled
debut
.

"
Revolution
"
was
also
recorded
for
the
self-titled
album
,
but
was
n't
included
because
it
did
n't
fit
the
theme
of
the
album
,
and
because
of
fear
that
listeners
would
take
the
lyrics
too
literally
,
especially
after
the
September
11
,
2001
attacks
.

"
Occam
's
Razor
"
was
also
recorded
,
but
was
never
included
on
any
of
the
band
's
releases
.

As
a
result
,
it
is
considered
the
most
difficult
to
locate
of
the
five
unreleased
tracks
.

Demo
versions
of
songs
on
the
band
's
self-titled
debut
were
also
slightly
different
,
along
with
different
names
.

For
example
,
"
Fallen
"
was
previously
called
"
Jupiter
"
,
and
"
Year
Zero
"
was
previously
called
"
Hero
"
.

Also
made
available
are
the
demo
versions
of
"
Buddha
for
Mary
"
and
"
93
Million
Miles
"
;
the
latter
originally
had
lyrics
referring
to
the
band
Deadsy
,
whose
members
Dr.
Nner
and
P.
Exeter
Blue
I
provided
extra
instrumentation
on
several
tracks
,
but
the
lyrics
were
changed
after
the
two
bands
were
involved
in
a
small
feud
.

During
recent
live
shows
,
the
band
has
premiered
two
new
songs
,
one
of
which
may
end
up
on
the
new
album
:
"
Some
Other
Son
"
and
"
The
Believer
"
,
which
were
initially
written
for
the
self-titled
album
but
was
scrapped
during
recording
,
as
well
as
live
songs
such
as
"
Sisters
of
Heresy
"
and
"
Under
Pressure
/
Pressure
"
(
Name
of
song
unsure
,
name
based
on
lyrics
)
.

They
also
have
a
song
called
"
Time
to
Wake
Up
.
"

On
December
11
,
2006
,
the
band
sent
their
fans
a
"
stocking
stuffer
"
in
the
form
of
a
holiday
song
called
"
Santa
Through
the
Back
Door
"
.

In
September
2007
,
the
band
also
recorded
a
cover
of
Kanye
West
's
"
Stronger
"
for
BBC
Radio
1
's
Live
Lounge
.

6PR
,
known
as
882
6PR
,
commenced
broadcasting
on
October
14
,
1931
.

6PR
's
focus
is
on
news
,
talk
and
sport
,
and
is
Perth
's
only
commercial
talkback
radio
station
.

6PR
is
owned
by
Fairfax
Media
,
an
Australian
media
company
that
owns
television
and
radio
businesses
throughout
Australia
.

Radio
in
Australia
was
just
twelve
years
old
when
6PR
commenced
broadcasting
on
October
14
,
1931
.

6PR
was
founded
by
electrical
company
Nicholson
's
Limited
,
which
ran
the
station
from
a
studio
above
its
showroom
in
Barrack
Street
,
Perth
.

In
1963
the
Victorian
Broadcasting
Network
purchased
Nicholson
's
and
sold
the
electrical
division
of
the
organisation
to
Vox
Adeon
.

The
broadcasting
business
was
retained
and
operated
under
the
name
Nicholson
's
Broadcasting
Service
Pty
Ltd
.

The
operation
moved
from
Barrack
Street
to
340
Hay
Street
just
after
the
purchase
by
the
VBN
in
1963
.

The
6PR
studio
remained
at
340
Hay
Street
for
22
years
before
it
was
demolished
to
make
way
for
the
expansion
of
Mercedes
College
.

In
1985
the
station
relocated
to
its
current
premises
at
169
Hay
Street
,
East
Perth
.

In
the
station
's
early
days
there
were
only
four
people
on
the
payroll
now
there
are
around
one
hundred
.

The
limited
hours
of
broadcasting
69
years
ago
have
gradually
been
increased
to
a
24
hour
,
seven
day
a
week
service
.

Throughout
the
sixties
6PR
was
consistently
the
top
rating
station
in
Perth
but
lost
its
dominance
in
1972
.

The
image
of
the
station
changed
from
rock
n
roll
to
beautiful
music
with
the
"
Gentle
On
Your
Mind
"
promotion
in
1973
.

This
boosted
6PR
's
ratings
to
a
consistent
number
two
with
a
number
one
position
on
several
occasions
.

In
1977
an
agreement
was
made
with
the
TAB
by
the
station
's
owners
to
broadcast
races
in
conjunction
with
a
personality
/
sport
format
.

In
the
early
eighties
the
station
commenced
a
more
comprehensive
news
and
current
affairs
format
with
the
introduction
of
regular
programs
by
Howard
Sattler
,
Bob
Maumill
and
Graham
Mabury
,
which
proved
extremely
popular
with
listeners
.

In
1987
the
TAB
purchased
6PR
to
secure
the
future
of
race
broadcasts
in
Western
Australia
and
races
were
broadcast
across
the
station
during
popular
talkback
programs
.

During
the
early
nineties
the
station
's
current
affairs
/
talkback
program
hosted
by
Sattler
,
Maumill
,
Mabury
,
Peter
Newman
,
Gary
Carvolth
and
Rob
Broadfield
achieved
considerable
success
in
spite
of
the
ever
increasing
level
of
racing
broadcasts
on
the
station
.

In
1994
6PR
,
in
conjunction
with
the
TAB
,
was
able
to
secure
a
special
narrowcast
broadcast
license
which
allowed
racing
broadcasts
to
be
moved
from
6PR
to
the
narrowcast
broadcaster
called
Racing
Radio
.

This
move
allowed
6PR
to
serve
its
two
distinct
audiences
,
those
who
listened
purely
for
a
talkback
/
news
/
current
affairs
format
and
those
who
listened
just
for
racing
information
,
in
a
more
comprehensive
manner
.

In
December
1994
6PR
was
purchased
by
its
current
owner
Southern
Cross
Broadcasting
which
also
owned
Melbourne
's
number
one
rating
talk
station
3AW
and
television
stations
in
Adelaide
,
Canberra
and
other
places
.

During
the
nineties
6PR
continued
its
dominance
in
the
talk
format
arena
with
personalities
such
as
David
Christison
&
Lee

Agnieszka
Lipska
Baranowska
(
1819
-
1890
)
was
a
Polish
playwright
and
poet
.

Born
on
April
16
,
1819
in
Gostkócity
near
�?ęczyca
in
a
Polish
szlachta
family
of
Lipscy
to
Jacob
Lipski
and
Marjania
Zaluska
,
she
spent
her
life
in
the
Prussian
partition
,
including
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Poznań
.

She
had
one
brother
,
Konstanty
,
who
died
when
she
was
six
.

She
was
married
in
1838
to
Stanisław
Baranowski
(
1806-1843
)
,
who
was
an
officer
in
the
Polish
forces
during
the
January
Uprising
.

After
her
husband
's
death
in
1843
,
while
she
was
pregnant
with
their
daughter
Stanisława
,
she
became
the
head
of
the
family
at
the
age
of
24
,
and
took
care
of
their
lands
in
Marszew
.

She
had
many
friends
and
colleagues
among
the
Polish
writers
of
the
Great
Emigration
,
some
of
whom
visited
her
manor
in
Marszew
.

They
included
Karol
Baliński
,
Teofil
Lenartowicz
,
Franciszek
Mickiewicz
and
Eweryst
Estkowski
.

She
took
part
in
many

and
sponsored
and
organized
various
festivities
or
organizations
(
such
as
the
Society
of
Scientific
Help
for
Girls
(
Towarzystwo
Pomocy

)
.

She
wrote

Agotes
or
Cagots
were
a
discriminated
minority
in
the
Navarrese
Pyrenees
,
Basque
provinces
,
Bearn
,
Gascony
and
also
Brittany
.

They
have
been
also
known
by
other
names
:
Cagots
,
Gahets
,
Gafets
in
France
;
Agotes
,
Gafos
in
Spain
;
and
Cacons
,
Cahets
,
Caqueux
and
Caquins
in
Brittany
.

The
earliest
mention
of
them
is
in
1288
,
when
they
appear
to
have
been
called
Christiens
or
Christianos
.

During
the
Middle
Ages
they
were
popularly
looked
upon
as
cretins
,
lepers
,
heretics
and
even
as
cannibals
.

They
were
shunned
and
hated
;
were
allotted
separate
quarters
in
towns
,
called
cagoteries
,
and
lived
in
wretched
huts
in
the
country
distinct
from
the
villages
.

Excluded
from
all
political
and
social
rights
,
they
were
only
allowed
to
enter
a
church
by
a
special
door
,
and
during
the
service
a
rail
separated
them
from
the
other
worshippers
.

Either
they
were
altogether
forbidden
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
,
or
the
Eucharist
was
handed
to
them
on
the
end
of
a
stick
,
while
a
receptacle
for
holy
water
was
reserved
for
their
exclusive
use
.

They
were
compelled
to
wear
a
distinctive
dress
,
to
which
,
in
some
places
,
was
attached
the
foot
of
a
goose
or
duck
(
whence
they
were
sometimes
called
Canards
)
.

And
so
pestilential
was
their
touch
considered
that
it
was
a
crime
for
them
to
walk
the
common
road
barefooted
.

The
only
trades
allowed
them
were
those
of
butcher
and
carpenter
,
and
their
ordinary
occupation
was
wood-cutting
.

The
origin
of
Agotes
(
or
Cagots
)
is
uncertain
.

It
has
been
suggested
that
they
were
descendants
of
the
Visigoths
,
and
somebody
derives
the
name
from
caas
(
dog
)
and
Goth
.

But
opposed
to
this
etymology
is
the
fact
that
the
word
"
cagot
"
is
first
found
in
this
form
no
earlier
than
1551
.

French
historian
Pierre
de
Marca
(
16th
century
)
,
in
his
Histoire
de
Beam
,
holds
that
the
word
signifies
hunters
of
the
Goths
,
and
that
the
Cagots
are
descendants
of
the
Saracens
.

Others
made
them
descendants
of
the
Albigenses
.

A
far
more
probable
explanation
of
their
name
Christians
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
in
medieval
times
all
lepers
were
known
as
pauperes
Christi
,
and
that
,
Goths
or
not
,
these
Cagots
were
affected
in
the
Middle
Ages
with
a
particular
form
of
leprosy
or
a
condition
resembling
it
.

Thus
would
arise
the
confusion
between
Christians
and
Cretins
.

It
was
not
until
the
French
Revolution
that
any
steps
were
taken
to
ameliorate
their
lot
,
but
today
they
no
longer
form
a
class
and
have
been
practically
lost
sight
of
in
the
general
peasantry
.

Aisby
is
a
village
in
the
English
county
of
Lincolnshire
,
known
as
Asebi
in

A
small

within

Grantham
,
Lincolnshire
,
not
to

The
Amateur
Hockey
Association
of
Canada
(
AHAC
)
was
an
amateur
men
's
ice
hockey
league
founded
in
1886
,
in
existence
until
1898
.

It
was
the
second
ice
hockey
league
organized
in
Canada
,
after
one
in
Kingston
,
Ontario
started
in
1883
.

It
was
organized
to
provide
a
longer
season
to
determine
the
Canadian
champion
.

Prior
to
its
founding
the
Canadian
championship
was
determined
in
a
tournament
in
Montreal
.

The
1893
champion
of
the
league
,
Montreal
Hockey
Club
was
the
first
winner
of
the
Stanley
Cup
,
being
awarded
the
Cup
as
the
champions
of
the
AHAC
and
the
AHAC
was
considered
the
top
league
of
Canada
.

of
various
hockey
clubs
met
at
the
Victoria
Skating
Rink
in
Montreal
at
the
instigation
of
the
Victoria
Hockey
Club
of
Montreal
.

They
agreed
that
the
season
should
run
from
the
1st
of
January
until
the
15th
of
March
.

The
constitution
would
be
adapted
from
a
lacrosse
league
constitution
.

The
teams
knew
each
other
.

Mr
.
Thomas
D
.
Green
of
Ottawa
had
played
on
the
1883
McGill
hockey
team
.

In
that
age
,
ice
hockey
was
a
very
different
game
compared
to
today
:
the
AHAC
rules
stated
that
there
were
six
skaters
on
each
side
.

The
left
wing
,
centre
and
right
wing
were
the
forwards
,
like
today
.

The
rover
would
line
up
behind
the
centre
,
with
the
point
and
coverpoint
following
,
in
an
'
I
'
formation
towards
the
goaltender
.

The
face
offs
were
at
a
right
angle
to
today
's
practice
,
the
centre
men
facing
inwards
from
the
sides
of
the
rink
.

The
goaltenders
used
no
special
equipment
.

There
were
no
goal
nets
.

The
goals
were
two
posts
,
with
no
crossbar
.

An
umpire
would
judge
the
legality
of
each
score
.

There
were
no
boards
along
the
sides
of
the
ice
,
and
there
were
no
standard
dimensions
for
a
rink
,
although
dimensions
were
instituted
for
the
positioning
of
the
goal
out
from
the
ends
of
the
rink
.

A
match
was
two
halves
of
thirty
minutes
(
also
to
note
that
in
the
day
,
game
meant
goal
by
modern
definition
)
.

Sudden-death
overtime
was
also
in
place
,
and
a
match
would
continue
until
a
goal
was
scored
in
the
event
of
a
tie
after
regulation
.

Players
in
all
positions
would
normally
play
the
entire
60
minutes
.

The
AHAC
operated
on
two
different
systems
in
its
lifetime
:
the
challenge
system
,
where
a
championship
team
would
face
a
new
challenger
each
week
for
the
championship
,
and
the
series
system
,
which
corresponds
to
the
regular
season
found
in
the
NHL
today
.

With
the
exception
of
1888
,
the
challenge
system
was
exclusively
used
in
the
AHAC
before
the
advent
of
the
Stanley
Cup
,
while
the
series
system
became
the
norm
in
1893
,
the
first
year
the
Cup
was
contested
.

The
first
championship
team
of
the
AHAC
was
the
Montreal
Crystals
,
having
unofficially
being
declared
the
champions
before
the
AHAC
.

The
first
title
change
occurred
on
January
14
,
1887
,
when
the
Montreal
Victorias
defeated
the
champions
4-0
.

The
Victorias
would
hold
the
title
until
the
very
last
challenge
game
,
when
the
Crystals
won
3-2
in
their
third
successive
challenge
.

Because
of
the
Vics
'
long
run
as
champions
,
it
was
decided
to
switch
to
the
series
system
in
1888
.

The
series
system
was
a
success
,
although
a
tie
atop
the
standings
between
the
Vics
and
the
Montreal
Hockey
Club
(
Montreal
HC
)
,
and
the
subsequent
scheduling
of
the
tiebreaker
game
caused
much
trouble
when
the
game
was
scheduled
at
a
time
when
two
Victorias
players
were
injured
,
at
the
home
venue
of
the
Montreal
HC
.

However
,
teams
from
outside
Montreal
incurred
huge
travelling
expenses
,
which
led
the
AHAC
to
revert
back
to
the
challenge
system
.

In
1893
,
the
first
year
since
1888
where
the
AHAC
played
under
a
series
system
,
the
Montreal
Hockey
Club
lost
their
first
game
against
the
Ottawa
Hockey
Club
,
and
proceeded
to
win
their
next
seven
en
route
to
the
championship
.

Lord
Stanley
announced
that
his
challenge
trophy
(
later
known
simply
as
the
Stanley
Cup
)
for
the
best
amateur
hockey
team
in
Canada
would
be
presented
to
the
Montreal
Hockey
Club
on
May
15
,
1893
,
as
initial
champion
.

At
the
time
,
the
Montreal
Hockey
Club
was
in
a
dispute
with
its
parent
organization
,
the
Montreal
Amateur
Athletic
Association
(
MAAA
)
.

The
hockey
club
was
adamant
about
refusing
the
trophy
,
while
the
directors
of
the
MAAA
decided
to
accept
the
trophy
,
considering
it
came
from
the
Governor
General
of
Canada
.

Thus
,
the
trophy
was
accepted
by
the
MAAA
,
but
with
none
of
the
hockey
officials
of
the
hockey
club
present
.

After
accepting
the
trophy
,
the
hockey
club
remained
adamant
about
returning
the
trophy
that
was
presented
to
them
.

In
the
end
,
the
MAAA
investigated
into
why
its
hockey
club
wanted
to
refuse
and
return
the
trophy
,
even
though
such
an
action
would
damage
the
reputation
of
the
MAAA
.

It
was
believed
that
the
people
who
were
in
charge
of
running
their
team
were
,
in
fact
,
not
representative
of
the
team
itself
,
and
when
the
hockey
club
asked
for
a
loan
of
$175
in
start-up
expenses
for
the
1894
season
,
it
was
flatly
refused
(
the
first
time
the
MAAA
refused
anything
to
the
hockey
club
)
.

Inexplicably
,
the
hockey
club
reversed
its
position
,
and
the
next
few
months
saw
a
gradual
schism
between
the
MAAA
and
the
club
.

Indeed
,
the
inscriptions
on
the
Cup
when
it
was
successfully
defended
in
1894
only
stated
"
Montreal
HC
"
.

The
MAAA
,
at
one
point
,
considered
the
hockey
club
to
have
seceded
from
the
organization
that
bore
them
.

The
issue
would
be
finally
resolved
in
later
years
,
after
various
attempts
at
reconciliation
.

Stanley
Cup
winner

According
to
Arthur
Farrell
's
book
of
1899
,
"
Hockey
:
Canada
's
Royal
Winter
Game
"
,
Montreal
Crystals
are
recorded
as
champions
in
1887
,
and
the
Montreal
Hockey
Club
is
recorded
as
the
winner
from
1888-1894
.

See

on
Backcheck
.

According
to
Ultimate
Hockey
,
the
play
between
1887
and
1892
occurred
in
the
challenge
format
and
the
title
of
champion
could
change
after
every
series
.

The
final
champion
at
the
end
of
the
season
's
worth
of
challenges
would
be
considered
'
Dominion
of
Canada
'
champion

Angela
Carder
(
née
Stone
)
was
an
American
cancer
patient
who
,
in
1987
,
was
forced
to
undergo
a
life-threatening
Caesarean
section
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
save
the
life
of
her
fetus
.

The
case
stands
as
a
landmark
in
United
States
case
law
establishing
the
rights
of
pregnant
women
to
determine
their
own
health
care
.

At
age
thirteen
,
Angela
Stoner
was
diagnosed
with
a
rare
and
usually
fatal
form
of
cancer
.

She
survived
,
and
after
years
of
chemotherapy
and
radiation
therapy
was
declared
to
be
in
remission
.

Ten
years
after
the
initial
diagnosis
she
developed
another
form
of
cancer
,
which
she
and
her
doctors
fought
with
equal
determination
.

The
second
cancer
went
into
remission
.

Angela
later
married
and
became
pregnant
.

In
1987
,
when
Carder
was
twenty-five
weeks
pregnant
,
her
cancer
was
discovered
to
have
recurred
and
metastasized
to
her
lung
.

Exactly
what
plan
she
made
on
learning
this
is
unclear
:
one
source
claims
that
she
was
determined
to
prolong
her
life
,
and
elected
to
start
radiation
and
chemotherapy
,
regardless
of
known
risks
to
the
fetus
;
others
state
that
she
chose
to
institute
only
palliative
care
,
in
an
effort
to
remain
alive
until
the
28th
week
of
gestation
,
when
it
was
thought
the
fetus
would
have
a
better
chance
of
survival
.

Whatever
her
choice
,
the
administrators
of
George
Washington
University
Hospital
--
who
were
also
the
liability
risk
managers
--
were
disturbed
to
hear
that
she
had
not
elected
to
have
an
immediate
C-section
procedure
.

Fearing
a
lawsuit
by
pro-life
activists
,
they
convened
a
court
hearing
at
the
hospital
and
obtained
separate
counsels
for
Carder
,
her
fetus
,
and
the
hospital
.

At
the
hearing
,
family
members
,
including
Carder
's
husband
,
opposed
the
C-section
on
the
grounds
that
she
would
be
unlikely
to
survive
it
and
that
she
would
not
want
it
(
Carder
herself
,
now
gravely
ill
,
did
not
testify
)
.

Her
treating
physicians
also
opposed
the
procedure
.

However
,
a
neonatologist
not
personally
familiar
with
her
medical
status
testified
that
the
fetus
would
have
at
least
a
60%
chance
of
survival
--
nearly
that
of
a
healthy
woman
's
fetus
at
the
same
gestational
age
.

Carder
's
own
long-term
oncologist
was
not
contacted
;
he
has
since
stated
that
he
would
have
called
the
procedure
"
medically
inadvisable
both
for
Angela
Carder
and
for
the
fetus
"
.

Nonetheless
,
and
despite
medical
testimony
that
such
a
procedure
would
probably
end
Carder
's
life
,
an
order
was
issued
authorizing
the
hospital
to
perform
an
immediate
C-section
.

Obstetricians
at
the
hospital
initially
refused
to
carry
out
the
procedure
,
but
eventually
one
reluctantly
agreed
.

A
three-judge
appellate
panel
upheld
the
decision
in
an
emergency
telephone
appeal
,
despite
Carder
's
own
repeated
pleas
of
"
I
do
n't
want
it
done
.
"

Exactly
how
long
the
fetus
survived
is
a
matter
of
some
dispute
.

The
most
commonly
cited
figure
is
two
hours
.

Susan
Faludi
quotes
the
obstetrician
who
performed
the
surgery
as
saying
attempts
to
inflate
the
fetus
's
lungs
were
"
like
trying
to
ventilate
a
rock
"
.

Angela
Carder
survived
her
surgery
by
two
days
.

In
the
wake
of
the
surgery
,
Carder
's
family
and
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
's
Reproductive
Freedom
Project
asked
the
D.C.
Court
of
Appeals
to
vacate
the
order
and
its
legal
precedent
,
on
grounds
that
the
order
had
violated
Carder
's
right
to
informed
consent
and
her
constitutional
rights
of
privacy
and
bodily
integrity
.

One
hundred
twenty
organizations
filed
amicus
briefs
on
Carder
's
behalf
,
including
the
American
Medical
Association
and
the
American
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists
.

One
attorney
for
the
hospital
argued
that
it
was
appropriate
to
sacrifice
a
dying
woman
for
her
fetus
;
an
appeals
court
judge
is
reported
to
have
replied
,
"
Are
you
urging
this
court
to
find
that
you
can
handcuff
a
woman
to
a
bed
and
force
her
to
give
birth
?
"

On
April
26
,
1990
,
the
court
issued
the
ruling
In
re
A.C.
,
which
vacated
the
previous
decisions
and
ruled
that
Angela
Carder
had
the
right
to
make
health-care
decisions
for
herself
and
her
fetus
.

At
the
same
time
as
the
Court
of
Appeals
case
,
the
ACLU
and
Carder
's
parents
,
Daniel
and
Nettie
Stoner
,
instituted
a
civil
action
,
Stoners
v.
George
Washington
University
Hospital
,
et
al.
,
suing
the
hospital
for
deprivation
of
human
rights
,
discrimination
,
wrongful
death
and
malpractice
,
among
other
charges
.

In
November
of
1990
,
days
before
the
scheduled
trial
was
to
begin
,
the
hospital
settled
out
of
court
for
an
undisclosed
amount
of
money
and
a
promise
of
new
hospital
policies
protecting
the
rights
of
pregnant
women

was

Fl.
But
raised
in
Miami
,
at
1
yrs
old
Angelo
's
family
had
been
living
in
the
historic
Hotel
Essex
on
Collins
Ave
in
Miami
Beach
after
having
left
their
country
in
pursuit
of
a
new
life
,
little
did

that
when
he
'd
grow
up
he

be
one
of
the
key

of
Miami
's

Nightlife
,
his
career
in
Marketing
,
Sales
,
Management
,
Consulting
&
Special
Events
began
in
1989
.

At
the
time
Miami
Beach
was
not
yet
called
South
Beach
and
the
entertainment
industry
had
begun
to
grow
in
Miami
.

With
not
much
to
do
those
days
most
people
resorted
to
having
many
house
parties
,
recalls
Angelo
.

With
a
very
diverse
background
in
every
type
of
industry
imaginable
Angelo
began
his
growth
in
Miami
as
a
young
Actor
/

working
many
non-union

.

His
Acting

Although
his
acting
career
was
taking
off
,
Angelo
decided
to
also
do
business

create
a
social

He
was

A
Portuguesa
is
the
national
anthem
of
Portugal
.

It
was
written
by
Henrique
Lopes
de
Mendonça
(
lyrics
)
and
Alfredo
Keil
(
music
)
after
the
nationalist
resurgence
provoked
by
the
British
Ultimatum
(
for
Portuguese
troops
to
vacate
the
territory
between
Angola
and
Mozambique
)
,
was
adopted
as
a
Republican
anthem
and
,
finally
,
by
the
new
Portuguese
Republic
in
1910
as
the
national
anthem
,
replacing
"
O
Hymno
da
Carta
"
,
the
last
anthem
of
the
Constitutional
Monarchy
in
Portugal
.

The
title
A
Portuguesa
means
"
the
Portuguese
(
song
)
"
---
the
Portuguese
word
for
"
song
"
,
canção
,
being
feminine
---
just
as
La
Marseillaise
,
the
national
anthem
of
France
,
is
"
the
song
of
Marseille
"
,
the
Belgian
anthem
,
The
Brabançonne
is
"
the
song
of
Brabant
"
,
and
L'Internationale
,
the
Socialist
anthem
,
is
"
the
international
(
song
)
"
.

In
1890
,
the
United
Kingdom
issued
an
ultimatum
demanding
Portugal
give
up
its
intentions
of
occupying
the
land
between
the
African
colonies
of
Angola
,
on
the
western
coast
,
and
Mozambique
,
on
the
eastern
coast
,
thus
joining
the
two
territories
.

Despite
popular
uproar
,
the
government
was
forced
to
accept
the
British
terms
,
a
measure
that
contributed
to
the
growing
unpopularity
of
King
Carlos
I
and
the
monarchy
and
gained
supporters
for
the
already
boosting
republican
movement
.

Inspired
by
the
common
feeling
of
outrage
among
the
people
,
writer
Henrique
Lopes
de
Mendonça
composed
a
poem
urging
his
compatriots
to
"
fight
for
the
fatherland
"
(
Pela
Pátri
luta
)
and
praising
the
country
's
past
as
a
naval
power
,
particularly
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
.

The
words
were
set
to
a
melody
by
composer
Alfredo
Keil
and
the
song
soon
became
popular
among
people
unhappy
with
what
they
considered
a
submissive
and
humiliating
attitude
by
the
Portuguese
authorities
.

On
January
31
,
1891
,
a
republican
revolution
broke
out
in
the
northern
city
of
Porto
and
"
A
Portuguesa
"
was
adopted
by
the
rebels
as
their
anthem
.

The
revolution
was
crushed
and
the
song
banned
.

In
1910
,
on
October
5
,
a
new
revolution
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
monarchy
and
establishing
a
republic
in
Portugal
.

In
the
following
year
,
1911
,
a
law
officialized
the
status
of
"
A
Portuguesa
"
as
Portugal
's
national
anthem
.

The
song
consists
of
the
first
stanza
from
Mendonça
's
poem
followed
by
a
chorus
.

The
second
and
third
verses
below
were
part
of
the
poem
,
but
are
not
included
in
the
anthem
(
and
are
indeed
unknown
to
even
exist
by
a
large
majority
of
Portuguese
)
.

The
fifth
line
of
the
chorus
:
"
Contra
os
canhões
marchar
,
marchar
"
(
Against
the
cannons
march
,
march
!
)
is
an
alteration
of
the
original
"
Contra
os
bretões
marchar
,
marchar
"
(
Against
the
Britos
march
,
march
!
)
,

Armistice
Day
is
the
anniversary
of
the
official
end
of
World
War
I
,
November
11
,
1918
.

It
commemorates
the
armistice
signed
between
the
Allies
and
Germany
at
Compiègn
,
Franc
,
for
the
cessation
of
hostilities
on
the
Western
Front
,
which
took
effect
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
---
the
"
eleventh
hour
of
the
eleventh
day
of
the
eleventh
month
.
"

While
this
official
date
to
mark
the
end
of
the
war
reflects
the
ceasefire
on
the
Western
Front
,
hostilities
continued
in
other
regions
,
especially
across
the
former
Russian
Empire
and
in
parts
of
the
old
Ottoman
Empire
.

The
date
was
a
national
holiday
in
many
of
the
former
allied
nations
to
allow
people
to
commemorate
those
members
of
the
armed
forces
who
were
killed
during
war
.

After
World
War
II
,
it
was
changed
to
Veterans
Day
in
the
United
States
and
to
Remembrance
Day
in
the
British
Commonwealth
of
Nations
.

Armistice
Day
is
an
official
holiday
in
France
.

It
is
also
an
official
holiday
in
Belgium
,
known
also
as
the
day
of
peace
in
the
Flanders
Fields
.

In
many
parts
of
the
world
,
people
take
two
minutes
of
silence
at
11:00
in
the
morning
as
a
sign
of
respect
for
the
roughly
eight
million
who
died
in
the
war
,
as
suggested
by
Edward
George
Honey
in
a
letter
to
a
British
newspaper
though
Wellesley
Tudor
Pole
established
two
ceremonial
periods
of
remembrance
based
on
events
in
1917
.

Beginning
in
1939
,
the
two-minute
silence
was
moved
to
the
Sunday
nearest
the
11th
,
in
order
not
to
interfere
with
wartime
production
should
the
11th
fall
on
a
weekday
.

Since
the
1990s
a
growing
number
of
people
have
observed
a
two-minute
silence
on
11
November
,
resulting
in
both
Armistice
Day
and
Remembrance
Sunday
being
commemorated
formally
in
the
UK
(
although
in
2007
they
fell
on
the
same
day
)
.

November
11th
2008
will
be
the
90th
anniversary
of
Armistice
Day
.

The
Australian
League
of
Rights
is
a
minor
political
organisation
in
Australia
founded
by
Eric
Butler
with
its
basis
in
the
economic
theory
of
Social
Credit
expounded
by
C.
H.
Douglas
.

It
describes
itself
as
upholding
the
virtues
of
freedom
.

It
is
not
a
political
party
,
but
rather
sees
itself
as
a
watchdog
against
government
intervention
.

The
League
was
formed
in
1960
by
a
merger
of
various
Leagues
of
Rights
based
in
the
Australian
states
,
the
first
of
which
was
based
in
South
Australia
from
1946
.

The
League
's
founder
Eric
Butler
died
on
June
9
2006
,
at
the
age
of
90
.

The
League
,
like
many
other
far-Right
organisations
,
strongly
denies
that
the
Holocaust
,
during
which
millions
of
people
,
particularly
European
Jews
,
were
killed
,
ever
occurred
.

It
is
strongly
supportive
of
the
polemicist
and
Holocaust
denial
advocate
David
Irving
.

They
believe
that
the
world
is
run
by
a
secret
society
of
Jews
.

The
League
is
distinctive
for
asserting
that
The
Protocols
of
the
Elders
of
Zion
is
a
genuine
Jewish
document
(
the
Encyclopædi
Britannica
for
example
describes
the
Protocols
as
a
"
fraudulent
document
that
served
as
a
pretext
and
rationale
for
anti-Semitism
in
the
early
20th
century
"
)
.

The
League
describes
itself
as
being
based
on
the
principles
of
Christianity
and
is
vehement
in
its
anti-communism
.

They
argue
in
favour
of
capitalism
by
promoting
the
sanctity
of
private
property
and
individual
enterprise
.

They
are
keen
promoters
of
Social
Credit
.

They
are
strongly
monarchist
and
completely
opposed
to
Australian
republicanism
and
see
the
links
to
Great
Britain
as
being
fundamental
to
Australian
identity
.

The
League
has
been
accused
of
being
associated
with
the
now-defunct
Australian
National
Socialist
Party
.

Former
Western
Australian
Labor
MP
,
founder
of
the
Australia
First
Party
and
later
One
Nation
member
Graeme
Campbell
was
associated
with
the
League
at
the
same
time
as
he
was
a
member
of
One
Nation
and
Australia
First
.

Mr
Campbell
stated
that
"
Australia
First
has
no
association
with
the
League
.

It
's
me
with
the
association
.
"

Former
treasurer
Peter
Costello
stated
that
One
Nation
's
policy
of
a
state
bank
which
would
issue
low-interest
loans
was
directly
taken
from
the
ALOR
,
and
that
"
the
League
of
Rights
is
driving
its
policy
in
relation
to
banking
and
money
"

The
Australian
branch
of
the
B'nai
B'rith
Anti-Defamation
Commission
issued
a
press
release
that
"
The
Co-founder
of
Australians
Against
Further
Immigration
(
AAFI
)
,
and
One
Nation
's
Victorian
leader
Robyn
Spencer
has
addressed
numerous
League
of
Rights
meetings
as
well
as
delivered
a
speech
with
League
of
Rights
,
Advisory
National
Director
Eric
Butler
.
"

ALOR
is
also
allegedly
associated
with
National
Action

In
the
1970s
and
early
1980s
,
the
League
attempted
to
gain
control
of
the
National
Party
of
Australia
,
encouraging
members
to
join
the
party
in
sufficient
numbers
to
take
control
,
a
tactic
known
as
entryism
.

Doug
Anthony
led
an
effort
to
defend
the
Party
from
the
League
by
recruiting
people
who
would
vote
against
them
.

After
a
long
struggle
over
several
years
,
the
existing
leadership
prevailed
.

A
surprising
consequence
of
this
struggle
was
that
the
National
Party
,
which
got
far
fewer
votes
than
either
the
Labor
or
Liberal
parties
,
had
more
members
.

This
fact
became
much
more
widely
known
than
the
reason
for
it
,
with
both
sides
keeping
the
struggle
out
of
the
media
.

It
has
been
associated
with
the
now-defunct
New
Zealand
League
of
Rights
,
the
Canadian
League
of
Rights
and
through
the
British
League
of
Rights
also
the
John
Birch
Society
in
the
United
States
.

Critics
have
pointed
to
the
past
participation
of
the
League
in
the
former
World
Anti-Communist
League
alongside
dictatorial
regimes
like
that
of
Augusto
Pinochet

The
Ayalon
Cave
is
a
large
underground
limestone
cave
located
near
Ramla
,
Israel
.

The
cave
,
300
feet
deep
,
with
its
branch
extends
almost
2.5
kilometres
making
it
the
second
largest
limestone
cave
in
Israel
.

Researchers
announced
that
they
have
so
far
discovered
eight
new
species
,
all
without
eyes
,
including
four
crustacean
species
and
four
terrestrial
species
,
previously
unknown
to
science
.

They
added
that
the
crustaceans
included
two
saltwater
species
and
two
freshwater
species
,
indicating
that
this
diversity
might
help
better
understand
the
water
history
of
the
region
.

The
cave
was
first
discovered
when
a
small
opening
was
discerned
in
a
quarry
near
Ramla
.

According
to
Professor
Amos
Frumkin
of
the
Hebrew
University
,
the
cave
is
unique
in
that
a
thick
layer
of
chalk
left
it
impermeable
to
water
.

The
cave
will
remain
closed
to
the
public
to
allow
scientific
investigation
to
continue
undisturbed
.

As
the
cave
was
completely
cut
off
from
the
outside
environment
,
it
sustained
an
independent
ecosystem
;
this
ecosystem
did
not
rely
on
sunlight
and
photosynthesis
,
or
on
organic
compounds
,
for
an
energy
source
.

Rather
,
energy
was
extracted
by
Chemoautotrophic
bacteria
,
living
in
a
film
on
top
of
the
pool
water
.

These
bacteria
produce
energy
by
oxidizing
the
sulfide
compounds
in
the
water
,
and
derive
organic
compounds
using
carbon
dioxide
from
the
air
.

These
compounds
form
the
basis
of
the
cave
's
ecosystem
.

The
French
Voulet-Chanoine
Mission
,
led
by
the
captains
Paul
Voulet
and
Julien
Chanoine
,
had
been
dispatched
in
1898
to
Africa
by
the
French
government
with
the
mission
to
conquer
the
territories
between
the
Niger
River
and
Lake
Chad
and
join
in
uniting
French
territories
in
West
Africa
.

After
leaving
French
Sudan
in
January
1899
,
they
ruthlessly
subjected
the
native
peoples
,
meeting
little
resistance
.

One
of
the
few
to
resist
was
the
sorcerer
queen
Sarraounia
,
ruler
of
the
Azna
,
a
pagan
people
in
a
long
Islamized
region
.

Determinated
to
bar
the
expedition
's
road
,
Sarraounia
wrote
to
Voulet
a
provocative
letter
full
of
insults
;
the
French
took
up
the
challenge
,
and
on
April
15
left
the
camp
marching
towards
the
villages
of
Lougou
and
Tougana
,
where
Sarraounia
had
concentrated
her
forces
.

The
day
after
,
at
6:00
,
started
what
Lt
.

Paul
Joalland
called
"
one
of
the
hottest
moment
of
the
campaign
"
.

The
French
found
the
enemy
assembled
on
the
field
,
while
women
and
children
had
already
retired
themselves
in
a
small
thick
and
almost
impenetrable
bush
where
the
Azna
defended
themselves
when
facing
a
superior
enemy
.

After
the
Azna
had
started
to
sisperse
under
the
French
gunfire
,
their
lines
broke
when
hit
by
three
grapeshot
balls
;
the
Azna
then
retreated
in
the
bush
,
where
the
thick
foliage
partly
protected
the
natives
from
the
gunfire
.

The
French
felt
that
if
left
there
,
the
Azna
may
attack
them
at
night
;
so
it
was
decideed
to
assault
the
bush
,
but
being
careful
to
leave
a
way
of
escape
for
the
Azna
open
,
so
to
avoid
a
too
deadly
confrontation
that
could
cost
too
much
blood
.

The
French
met
a
strong
resistance
,
killing
2
riflemen
and
wounding
4
,
but
were
at
the
end
successful
and
forced
the
Azna
to
escape
.

The
battle
had
protracted
itself
till
13:00
,
and
among
the
French
tirailleurs
4
were
killed
and
6
wounded

with

The
Battle
of
Vilcapugio
was
fought
on
October
1
,
1813
during
the
Campaign
of
Alto
Peru
in
the
Argentine
War
of
Independence
,
where
the
pro-independence
forces
led
by
General
Manuel
Belgrano
were
defeated
by
the
pro-Spanish
Realists
,
led
by
Joaquin
de
la
Pazuela
.

The
Campaign
was
restarted
upon
the
insistence
of
the
government
in
Buenos
Aires
after
the
Army
of
the
North
's
victories
during
the
Battles
of
Tucumán
and
Salta
.

Despite
having
malaria
and
having
to
command
a
company
of
new
conscripts
with
insufficient
artillery
,
Belgrano
accepted
the
commanding
post
.

Belgrano
's
army
was
supported
by
Colonel
Baltasar
Cárdenas
and
the
2,000
poorly
organized
natives
under
his
command
,
and
Colonel
Cornelio
Zelaya
with
forces
from
Cochabamba
.

Both
colonels
had
orders
to
incite
rebellion
amongst
the
indigenous
populations
who
provided
the
realists
with
valuable
information
.

Knowing
that
the
realist
army
did
not
have
enough
mules
to
move
its
artillery
and
provisions
,
Belgrano
planned
to
use
a
pincer
movement
to
attack
,
confidently
believing
that
Pezuela
would
not
provide
much
resistance
.

At
the
end
of
September
1813
,
most
of
Belgrano
's
army
arrived
in
the
prairie
of
Vilcapugio
,
which
was
a
plateau
surrounded
by
tall
mountains
to
the
north
of
Potosí
.

The
realist
troops
were
encamped
at
Condo-Condo
under
the
orders
of
Pazuela
and
Major
Saturnino
Castro
,
which
allowed
them
to
cut
off
Cárdenas
'
troops
and
any
communication
between
Belgrano
and
the
Cochabamban
forces
.

Castro
also
attained
documents
from
Cárdenas
giving
instructions
to
Belgrano
.

With
these
documents
Pazuela
was
able
to
interrupt
Belgrano
's
plans
and
began
his
advance
on
the
mountains
on
October
1
.

Belgrano
's
army
veterans
from
the
North
contained
the
left
flank
and
center
column
of
the
realist
army
and
forced
them
to
back
down
until
Pezuela
recognized
he
was
losing
the
battle
at
Virrey
de
Lima
;
however
,
his
own
left
flank
remained
in
action
and
defeated
Belgrano
's
right
column
.

The
realist
army
reorganized
itself
and
appropriated
all
of
its
artillery
,
continuously
shelling
the
few
soldiers
left
in
Belgrano
's
encampment
.

Belgrano
and
Eustaquio
Díaz
Vélez
had
decided
that
Vel
would
be
the
one
to
go
to
Potosí
to
reunite
with
the
dispersed
troops
.

Díaz
Vélez
took
command
over
the
troops
in
Potosí
after
Vilcapugio
with
the
rest
of
the
army
on
the
left
flank
of
the
enemy
.

At
this
point
the
troops
organized
themselves
to
pursue
the
Campaign
of
Alto
Perú
according
the
orders
of
the
government
of
Buenos

In
general
,
the
index
consists
of
a
minimum
of
10
and
a
maximum
of
20
companies
traded
at
the
Brussels
Stock
Exchange
.

Since
Nyrstar
was
promoted
to
the
index
on
4
March
2008
,
the
BEL20
has
contained
a
full
20
listings
.

The
composition
of
the
BEL20
index
is
reviewed
annually
based
on
closing
prices
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
.

These
changes
are
effected
on
the
first
trading
day
of
every
March
.

In
addition
to
meeting
a
set
of
criteria
demanding
a
company
be
"
representative
of
the
Belgian
equity
market
"
,
at
least
15%
of
its
shares
must
be
considered
free
float
in

to
qualify
for
the
index
.

In

market
capitalisation
(
in

)
of
at
least
300000
times
the
price
of
the
index
on
the
last
trading
day
of
December
.

The
minimum
requirement
for
an
existing

Ben
Player
Ben
is
the
current
2007
World
Champion
.

He
is
known
for
his
flawless
bodyboarding
style
and
massive
charging
.

His
victory
came
after
placing
second
(
narrowly
being
defeated
by
Damian
King
)
in
the
2006
Pipeline
final
.

He
has
finished
#
2
overall
on
the
world
bodyboarding
tour
several
times
.

Ben
now
also
helps
run
Movement
Bodyboarding
Magazine
.

The
Shark
Island
Challenge
is
Australia
's
richest
bodyboarding
competition
,
bankrolled
to
the
tune
of
$120,000
.

But
as
they
say
,
money
ca
n't
buy
love
--
or
,
as
was
the
case
in
July
2005
,
wave
action
.

When
the
month-long
waiting
period
ran
out
without
a
hint
of
swell
,
organisers
were
forced
to
put
the
outcome
in
the
hands
of
competitors
.

And
so
the
first
stop
on
the
World
Bodyboarding
Tour
would
be
decided
by
a
vote
:
either
split
the
prize
money
and
the
championship
points
evenly
between
all
competitors
,
or
run
the
comp
in
the
puny
swell
benignly
flopping
over
a
rock
ledge
usually
famous
for
its
forbidding
risk
to
life
and
limb
.

"
I
just
thought
,
'
You
fools
,
this
is
what
we
do
'
,
"
says
Ben
Player
,
one
of
only
two
pro
riders
who
voted
to
compete
.

At
28
,
he
sensed
his
chances
of
ever
winning
a
world
title
receding
with
each
hand
raised
in
opposition
:
he
had
fancied
his
chances
at
the
infamous
Island
.

Retreating
to
his
car
,
he
broke
down
and
cried
,
angered
and
frustrated
by
his
peers
'
reluctance
to
man
up
at
a
spot
that
has
always
rewarded
the
brave
.

He
paddled
out
anyway
,
an
overt
display
of
defiance
against
the
group
's
decision
-
albeit
a
failed
one
.

"
I
ended
up
cutting
my
hand
pretty
badly
on
the
reef
.

It
was
n't
rideable
at
all
...
"

Six
months
later
he
was
in
Hawaii
in
January
06
for
the
final
stop
on
the
world
tour
.

The
irony
of
that
frigid
afternoon
in
Cronulla
did
n't
dawn
on
Player
as
he
paddled
out
in
flawless
,
two-metre
waves
for
the
final
of
the
Pipeline
Pro
;
he
was
too
preoccupied
with
matters
at
hand
.

After
further
tour
stops
in
Chile
,
Portugal
and
Maui
,
the
two
riders
left
in
the
hunt
for
the
2006
crown
were
the
same
pair
who
had
voted
in
favour
of
going
ahead
at
Shark
Island
-
Ben
Player
and
Queenslander
Mitchell
Rawlins
.

With
Rawlins
knocked
out
in
the
quarters
,
Ben
needed
to
place
at
least
second
in
the
final
to
realise
his
dream
of
becoming
world
champ
.

His
surfing
in
that
30-minute
final
was
truly
world
class
,
combining
clean
barrels
with
solid
boosts
.

Ben
opened
up
a
lead
early
that
he
would
hold
on
to
through
to
the
siren
.

Not
just
the
master
of
Pipeline
,
but
champion
of
the
world
...

Then
,
further
controversy
.

In
the
hazy
,
backlit
conditions
of
the
late
afternoon
,
it
was
revealed
that
the
judges
had
confused
the
riders
,
awarding
Player
the
points
for
a
ride
his
opponent
had
made
.

Scores
were
hastily
revised
,
then
the
gutting
news
:
Player
had
been
relegated
to
runner-up
,
just
moments
before
he
was
due
to
be
presented
with
the
Pipeline
trophy
.

The
confusion
soured
the
occasion
.

But
Ben
Player
was
bodyboarding
's
newest
world
champion
.

This
month
Player
returns
to
Hawaii
to
defend
his
title
.

No
such
contest
debacles
this
year
,
which
means
Ben
Player
is
more
ambitious
than
ever
to
win
it
clean
.

And
again
it
will
all
come
down
to
Pipeline
,
where
his
performances
every
winter
since
he
first
arrived
as
a
wiry
16-year-old
have
made
him
a
stand
out
,
no
matter
what
surfcraft
you
favour
,
as
even
the
greatest
surfer
on
the
planet
will
attest
.

"
Ben
gets
a
fair
share
of
respect
from
the
crew
there
,
"
says
Kelly
Slater
.

"
He
does
n't
really
say
all
that
much
but
seems
to
get
the
job
done
right
.

He
has
a
good
eye
for
how
to
ride
a
wave
.

A
great
surfer
is
a
great
surfer
,
no
matter
what
they
ride
.
"

That
wiry
frame
has
filled
out
during
the
13
seasons
he
's
spent
hassling
for
waves
amongst
the
hungry
pack
of
board
riders
who
converge
on
the
famous
stretch
of
sand
every
northern
winter
.

He
shares
physical
traits
with
his
brother
Toby
,
also
a
pro
bodyboarder
and
half
the
reason
why
the
name
Player
has
been
tattooed
on
everything
bodyboarding
since
the
sport
's
boom
days
of
the
mid-1990s
.

"
You
ca
n't
help
but
be
competitive
with
your
brother
,
"
Ben
says
of
their
early
years
riding
the
wedging
peaks
of
Whale
Beach
,
on
Sydney
's
northern
beaches
.

As
the
younger
sibling
,
Ben
was
constantly
surfing
with
guys
his
senior
,
something
he
feels
refined
his
talent
and
drive
.

"
The
fact
Toby
was
more
popular
than
me
just
made
me
even
more
competitive
.
"

In
fact
Ben
Player
's
biography
reflects
the
twists
and
turns
of
the
phenomenal
growth
of
this
comparatively
new
sport
.

Player
won
Australian
titles
as
a
cadet
(
under-16s
)
and
as
a
pro
in
2000
,
part
of
the
new
generation
that
reshaped
bodyboarding
in
Australia
.

This
crew
put
new
emphasis
on
style
and
fluidity
in
big
moves
and
heavy
situations
,
keeping
their
bodies
and
legs
tight
and
in
control
through
monstrous
airs
,
milking
power
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
wave
--
the
bowl
that
forms
in
front
of
the
barrelling
section
.

His
progressive
riding
and
surfer-good
looks
made
him
the
complete
package
,
but
at
24
,
when
he
might
have
been
cashing
in
,
his
seat
at
the
head
of
bodyboarding
's
table
was
kicked
out
from
under
him
.

At
the
start
of
the
new
millennium
,
surf
brands
began
pulling
out
of
bodyboarding
.

"
Three
years
ago
I
lost
both
sponsors
on
the
same
day
.

[
Surfwear
label
]
Quiksilver
totally
pulled
out
of
bodyboarding
and
the
company
distributing
Morey
boards
went
bankrupt
,
so
of
course
my
contract
went
bust
.

Basically
I
lost
$85,000
for
that
year
and
$35,000
that
was
owed
to
me
,
"
says
Player
.

Player
pinpoints
Mike
Stewart
--
the
undisputed
guru
of
bodyboarding
who
had
pioneered
the
sport
--
for
kick-starting
an
era
of
self-reliance
and
self-belief
,
backed
by
his
call
to
"
support
those
who
support
bodyboarding
"
.

A
kind
of
evangelistic
patriotism
swept
through
the
sport
.

First
came
the
launch
of
bodyboard-specific
clothing
brands
,
then
wetsuits
and
accessories
.

Now
bodyboarding
specific
stores
have
opened
to
cater
for
the
newly
independent
industry
.

"
The
sport
is
in
a
much
better
position
now
,
"
Player
will
tell
you
.

"
It
's
still
growing
,
but
with
the
money
remaining
in
bodyboarding
.
"

The
thought
of
quitting
never
entered
his
head
.

"
It
was
more
a
question
of
'
How
am
I
going
to
make
ends
meet
?
"

He
'd
always
harboured
a
creative
streak
,
was
an
avid
scribe
within
the
sport
and
a
self-taught
graphic
designer
...
The
answer
seems
obvious
now
:
Player
pooled
the
last
of
his
savings
with
a
couple
of
friends
and
launched
a
magazine
.

"
The
only
other
bodyboarding
magazine
on
the
market
was
aimed
at
a
young
teenage
audience
,
and
here
I
was
20-something
and
I
could
n't
relate
.

I
wanted
to
make
something
I
could
show
people
and
say
,
'
Hey
,
this
is
what
I
do
.
'
"

For
the
first
two
years
Player
sold
advertising
for
the
mag
,
which
was
named
Movement
.

It
now
employs
four
people
(
yes
,
including
this
author
)
.

Player
's
been
able
to
step
away
from
the
day-to-day
business
,
but
the
magazine
is
a
venture
that
will
keep
him
firmly
rooted
in
the
sport
.

It
has
even
re-energised
his
passion
for
the
sport
.

"
The
more
I
worked
on
Movement
the
more
stoked
I
became
on
bodyboarding
again
.
"

As
the
street
cred
of
bodyboarding
evolved
,
so
did
the
dynamics
of
the
sport
.

Bodyboarders
now
seek
out
the
sort
of
aquatic
slabs
breaking
in
shallow
water
that
stand-up
surfers
leave
alone
.

"
On
a
bodyboard
you
can
handle
much
steeper
situations
.

Being
prone
means
you
can
ride
over
very
shallow
,
ledging
reefs
,
sometimes
just
inches
deep
,
where
you
wo
n't
get
knocked
off
by
steps
in
the
wave
.
"

This
extreme
element
comes
with
heavy
consequences
.

During
a
contest
in
Tahiti
a
few
years
ago
,
Player
pulled
into
a
barrel
that
shut
down
on
him
.

When
he
finally
came
up
for
air
,
he
was
bleeding
from
both
ears
from
the
sheer
pressure
exerted
by
the
imploding
wave
.

"
I
think
surfing
actually
embraces
bodyboarding
much
more
now
,
because
it
's
not
really
seen
as
competition
--
we
're
something
totally
different
,
"
he
says
.

"
We
're
surfing
our
own
waves
and
we
've
got
our
own
industry
.
"

The
revamped
world
tour
now
showcases
the
sport
at
surf
breaks
that
suit
the
craft
.

Shark
Island
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
,
the
shallow
rock
bottom
creating
a
warping
barrel
with
an
ideal
end
section
which
allows
them
to
launch
into
aerial
manoeuvres
.

The
contest
site
in
Chile
is
similar
,
though
a
true
peak
that
barrels
both
ways
.

Then
there
is
Hawaii
's
Pipeline
,
the
ideal
of
perfection
whether
you
're
standing
up
or
lying
down
.

Portugal
is
the
exception
on
the
tour
,
a
playful
beach
break
,
but
it
retains
its
status
on
the
tour
due
to
the
carnival
atmosphere
that
the
sport
attracts
in
Europe
,
as
well
as
in
South
America
.

In
Australia
,
the
majority
of
top
pros
tend
to
remain
nameless
outside
the
sport
's
domain
;
in
Europe
they
are
feted
like
rock
gods
,
mobbed
by
adoring
fans
wherever
they
go
.

The
organisers
of
the
world
tour
--
now
chaired
by
Mr
Bodyboarding
himself
,
Mike
Stewart
--
say
they
are
n't
done
yet
with
their
expansion
,
but
they
're
certainly
got
the
sport
on
its
feet
...
so
to
speak
.

But
for
now
the
eyes
of
the
bodyboarding
world
are
again
squinting
out
towards
the
chunk
of
lava
that
lies
submerged
off
the
North
Shore
of
Oahu
.

Mixed
results
on
tour
this
year
have
Ben
Player
trailing
on
points
in
the
race
for
the
championship
title
,
but
he
's
been
in
Hawaii
for
two
months
honing
his
act
in
preparation
for
his
world
title
defence
in
mid-to-late
January
.

If
the
waves
stay
away
and
the
top
pros
had
to
vote
their
champion
in
,
you
could
count
on
Player
power
winning
the
day

from

,
to
St.

.

B&SR
design
was
based
on
experience
of
the
Sandy
River
Railroad
.

Hinkley
Locomotive
Works
modified
their
2-foot
gauge
Forney
design
to
run
boiler
first
with
an
extended
frame
similar
to
that
installed
on
Sandy
River
Railroad
#
1
following
a
wreck
in
early
1882
.

The
successful
design
of
the
Bridgton
Hinkleys
was
subsequently
repeated
for
the
Monson
Railroad
and
the
Franklin
and
Megantic
Railway
.

Construction
began
in
1882
,
and
trains
were
running
to
Bridgton
by
early
1883
.

B&SR
used
early
profits
to
replace
wooden
trestles
with
earthen
fills
.

A
14-foot
granite
masonry
arch
was
constructed
over
Hancock
Brook
in
1895
.
track
was
extended
to
Harrison
with
35
#
steel
rails
in
1898
.

Trestles
on
the
Harrison
extension
had
been
replaced
by
earthen
fills
and
plate
girder
bridges
by
1906
.

Original
Hinkley
locomotives
#
1-2
were
replaced
by
#
5-6
of
an
improved
design
with
pilot
wheels
.

B&SR
then
replaced
the
original
30
#
steel
rails
from
Bridgton
Junction
to
Bridgton
with
48
#
and
50
#
steel
rails
from
1907
to
1910
before
Maine
Central
Railroad
secured
control
of
the
B&SR
in
1912
.

Under
Maine
Central
operation
,
there
were
4
mixed
train
round
trips
daily
from
Harrison
to
Bridgton
Junction
and
return
.

The
first
left
Harrison
at
5:15
AM
and
the
last
returned
to
Harrison
at
8:45
PM
.

Train
speed
seldom
exceeded
20
miles
per
hour
.

Two
passenger
train
sets
were
required
for
this
service
.

The
first
consisted
of
baggage
#

,
RPO
#

,
and
one
or
two
coaches
.

A
couple
of
bench
seats
at

the

2-foot

.

Bond
interest
went
unpaid
in
1926
,
and
the
town
of
Bridgton
began
a
15-year
effort
to
preserve
their
railroad
.

The
B&SR
was
reorganized
as
the
Bridgton
and
Harrison
;
but
the
extension
to
Harrison
was
dismantled
after
locomotive
#
8
tipped
over
when
the
35
#
rails
sagged
in
1930
.

Locomotive
#
8
was
the
heaviest
locomotive
on
any
2-foot
gauge
railway
in
Maine
.

B&SR
became
a
tourist
attraction
as
the
last
2-foot
gauge
railroad
offering
passenger
service
in
the
late
1930
's
.

Operation
ceased
in
September
1941
.

The
rolling
stock
was
preserved
when
the
rails
were
converted
to
scrap
metal
as
the
United
States
prepared
for
World
War
II
.

The
rolling
stock
was
moved
to

half-century
of
operation
on

Playfield
so
as
not

The
capture
gun
,
also
called
a
dart
gun
,
is
an
invention
which
was
refined
by
a
team
headed
by
Dr
Tony
Pooley
and
Dr
Toni
Harthoorn
in
Kenya
in
the
early
1960
's
.

Since
then
it
has
become
the
standard
tool
for
capture
of
large
and
medium-sized
animals
to
transport
them
safely
.

The
original
piston-operated
medium-bore
gun
fired
a
tranquilizer
dart
which
is
a
syringe
which
was
loaded
with
a
dose
of
barbiturate
and
/
or
other
drugs
,
backed
by
a
ball
bearing
which
was
separated
from
the
drug
mix
with
a
wadding
.

On
impact
with
the
animal
the
inertial
momentum
of
the
balls
injects
the
drug
into
the
animal
,
causing
torpor
and
prostration
within
minutes
.

Because
of
the
power
of
the
drugs
the
handlers
then
have
to
move
quickly
to
secure
the
animal
for
transport
,
monitor
its
vital
signs
,
protect
its
eyes
and
ears
,
and
then
inject
reversing
drugs
when
needed
.

Many
large
animals
are
acutely
sensitive
to
stress
and
can
easily
die
without
careful
treatment
.

One
major
discovery
by
Dr
Harthoorn
's
team
was
that
different
species
,
despite
being
of
roughly
equal
size
(
for
example
the
rhinoceros
and
the
buffalo
)
needed
very
different
doses
and
spectra
of
drugs
to
safely
immobilise
them
.

In
some
species
the
margin
of
error
is
very
small
indeed
.

Modern
capture
guns
are
gas-fired
and
collapsible
.

Several
models
are
available

a
fifteen-time

met
Sunderland

footballer
Dave
Buchanan

he
bought
a
health
club
in

The
health
club
went

was
sold
,
leaving
Citrone
(
who
was

in
need

He
found
this
in
poker

was
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison
for
smuggling
2,700,000

Citrone
denied
his
involvement
,
indicating
that
the
person
responsible
was
a

,
refused
to
go
on

implicate
the
poker
player
in
question
who
was
a

to
pay
some

generation
.

Known
as
the
"
Poet
of
the
Piano
"
,
Carmen
Cavallaro
showed
a
gift
for
music
from
age
3
,
picking
out
tunes
on
a
toy
piano
.

His
parents
were
encouraged
by
a
friend
to
develop
the
child
's
musical
talents
and
he
studied
classical
piano
in
the
United
States
.

As
a
young
pianist
,
he
toured
Europe
performing
in
many
capitals
.

In
1933
,
Cavallaro
joined
the
jazz
band
of
Al
Kavelin
,
where
he
quickly
became
the
featured
soloist
.

After
four
years
he
switched
to
a
series
of
other
big
bands
,
including
Rudy
Vallee
's
in
1937
.

He
also
worked
briefly
with
Enrico
Madriguera
and
Abe
Lyman
.

Starting
his
own
band
,
a
five-piece
combo
,
in
St.
Louis
in
1939
,
his
popularity
grew
and
his
group
expanded
into
a
14-piece
orchestra
,
releasing
some
19
albums
for
Decca
over
the
years
.

Although
his
band
traveled
the
country
and
played
in
all
the
top
spots
,
he
made
a
particular
impact
at
the
Mark
Hopkins
Hotel
in
San
Francisco
,
which
became
a
favourite
venue
,
and
which
many
years
later
,
was
to
be
re-visited
in
the
same
way
by
George
Shearing
and
Mel
Tormé
.

Other
venues
where
he
drew
large
and
devoted
audiences
included
New
York
's
Waldorf-Astoria
,
Chicago
's
Palmer
House
and
the
Los
Angeles
'
Coconut
Grove
.

In
1963
,
he
had
a
million
seller
hit
with
the
song
Sukiyaki
.

Cavallaro
developed
a
piano
style
of
glittering
and
rippling
arpeggios
to
augment
his
melody
,
which
was
often
arranged
in
thick
and
lush
triple
and
quadruple
octave
chords
.

His
musical
interests
and
arrangements
included
dance
music
,
particularly
Latin
rhythms
,
tangos
and
strict
tempo
dancing
styles
,
as
well
as
some
pop
and
jazz
arrangements
of
classical
melodies
.

In
this
,
he
is
often
cited
as
being
influenced
by
pianist
Eddy
Duchin
.

Liberace
was
greatly
influenced
by
both
Cavallaro
and
Duchin
.

All
three
shared
a
propensity
for
arranging
classical
piano
themes
in
a
pop
idiom
.

Cavallaro
also
became
famous
through
the
medium
of
radio
and
film
,
firstly
with
his
regular
program
on
NBC
during
the
1940
's
,
The
Schaeffer
Parade
,
of
which
he
was
the
host
and
later
in
films
where
he
played
himself
,
starting
with
Hollywood
Canteen
(
1944
)
,
then
Diamond
Horseshoe
(
1945
)
and
Out
of
This
World
(
1945
)
.

His
most
celebrated
film
achievement
was
playing
the
piano
music
for
actor
Tyrone
Power
's
hands
to
mime
,
in
The
Eddy
Duchin
Story
(
1956
)
.

Carmen
Cavallaro
died
from
cancer
on
10th
December
in
1989
in
Columbus
,

Carter
Anthony
Beauford
(
born
November
2
,
1957
in
Charlottesville
,
Virginia
)
is
a
drummer
,
percussionist
,
and
founding
member
of
the
Dave

Band
(
DMB

.

He
is
known
for
his
ability
to
mix
together
countless
percussion
styles
,
his
ambidextrous
approach
to
playing
,
and
is
highly
regarded
for
his
open
hand
drumming
style
,
where
his
left
hand
leads
on
the
hi-hat
and
ride
cymbal
in
a
conventional
right-handed
drumset
set-up
.

Beauford
was
exposed
to
sandbox
and
drumming
at
the
age
of
three
.

At
the
time
,
his
father
had
bought
tickets
to
a
Buddy
Rich
concert
and
could
not
find
someone
to
watch
his
son
,
so
he
took
young
Carter
along
to
the
show
.

Carter
was
mesmerized
by
Buddy
Rich
on
stage
.

After
that
show
,
Carter
's
father
bought
his
son
a
tin
drum
set
with
paper
heads
since
Carter
showed
much
interest
in
learning
the
instrument

performed
regularly
at

.

Eventually
,
Dave
approached
both
Carter
and
LeRoi
regarding
some
music
he
had
written
that
he
wished
to
record
.

Upon
listening
,
Beauford
agreed
,
thus
establishing
his
permanent
status
as

CBS
Cable
was
an
early
cable
network
operated
by
CBS
,
Inc.
,
dedicated
to
the
lively
arts
(
i.e.
symphony
,
dance
,
theatre
,
opera
,
etc
.
)
.

It
debuted
in
October
1981
and
ceased
operations
on
December
17
,
1982
.

CBS
Cable
was
a
personal
project
of
CBS
founder
William
Paley
,
who
hoped
it
would
blaze
a
trail
for
cultural
programming
in
the
then-emerging
cable
television
medium
.

Its
program
offerings
were
ambitious
and
often
critically
praised
.

Nevertheless
the
network
struggled
,
and
ultimately
failed
,
largely
because
of
the
reluctance
of
many
cable
systems
across
the
United
States
to
give
it
carriage
,
limiting
severely
its
ability
to
attract
both
viewers
and
advertisers
for
its
costly
lineup
of
programming
.

Cable
systems
in
the
early
1980s
had
far
more
limited
channel
capacity
than
they
do
today
(
usually
only
a
few
dozen
channels
in
most
cities
)
.

CBS
Cable
was
competing
for
channel
space
by
appealing
to
a
select
and
relatively
small
upscale
audience
,
while
other
networks
coming
on
line
at
the
same
time
such
as
MTV
and
ESPN
promised
larger
and
more
broad-based
viewership
and
therefore
got
cable
operators
to
carry
them
far
more
easily
.

MTV
and
ESPN
thrived
and
gave
rise
to
additional
companion
channels
within
a
short
time
,
while
the
CBS
Cable
channel
folded
after
just
over
14
months
in
operation
.

Not
to
be
confused
with
the
CBS-operated
cable
network
,
Eye
On
People
,
which
debuted
in
1997
and
soon
turned
into
Discovery
People
,
ultimately
reorganized
into

Chad
Edward
Gaudin
(
pronounced
go-DAN
)
(
born
March
24
,
1983
in
New
Orleans
,
Louisiana
)
is
a
right-handed
starting
pitcher
for
the
Oakland
Athletics
of
Major
League
Baseball
.

Gaudin
attended
Crescent
City
High
School
in
Metairie
,
Louisiana
.

He
earned
All-State
and
district
MVP
in
his
junior
and
senior
years
.

Gaudin
was
selected
by
the
Tampa
Bay
Devil
Rays
right
out
of
high
school
in
the
34th
round
(
1009th
overall
pick
)
of
the
2001
Major
League
Baseball
Draft
.

He
signed
on
August
23
,
2001
and
did
not
play
professionally
until
2002
.

He
played
in
Single
A
in
2002
and
recorded
a
2.26
ERA
which
ranked
him
10th
in
all
of
minor
league
baseball
.

On
July
15
,
2003
,
in
his
first
start
after
getting
called
up
from
the
Class
A
California
League
,
Gaudin
took
the
mound
in
the
first
game
of
a
doubleheader
for
the
AA
Orlando
Rays
on
the
road
against
the
Jacksonville
Suns
and
threw
a
7-inning
perfect
game
,
retiring
all
21
batters
he
faced
.

(
Two
7-inning
games
is
the
standard
for
a
doubleheader
in
most
minor
leagues
;
Major
League
Baseball
would
later
amend
a
rule
recognizing
only
efforts
of
at
least
nine
innings
as
official
perfect
games
.
)

Gaudin
made
only
two
more
starts
and
posted
an
0.47
ERA
for
Orlando
before
Devil
Rays
'
Manager
Lou
Piniella
summoned
him
to
the
big
league
club
.

When
Gaudin
made
his
major
league
debut
,
he
had
become
the
youngest
Devil
Ray
in
club
history
at
20
years
and
4
months
and
was
the
4th
youngest
player
in
the
majors
.

After
posting
a
very
respectable
2-0
record
and
3.60
ERA
in
15
appearances
(
including
3
starts
)
in
2003
for
the
Devil
Rays
,
he
went
1-2
with
a
4.85
ERA
in
26
appearances
(
4
starts
)
in
2004
while
splitting
time
with
AAA
Durham
.

On
December
12
,
2004
,
Gaudin
was
traded
to
the
Toronto
Blue
Jays
for
backup
catcher
Kevin
Cash
.

Although
he
pitched
well
as
a
starter
at
AAA
Syracuse
,
he
was
just
1-3
with
a
13.15
ERA
in
5
appearances
(
3
starts
)
with
the
Blue
Jays
.

Opponents
had
batted
.470
against
him
in
just
13
innings
(
31
hits
)
.

On
December
5
,
2005
,
he
was
traded
to
the
Athletics
for
a
player
to
be
named
later
,
who
later
turned
out
to
be
outfielder
Dustin
Majewski
.

Gaudin
began
the
2006
season
for
the
Sacramento
River
Cats
,
the
Athletics
Triple
A
team
.

He
was
recalled
by
the
Athletics
after
posting
an
0.37
ERA
in
4
starts
for
the
River
Cats
and
pitched
in
relief
for
the
rest
of
the
season
for
the
big
league
club
.

In
his
first
season
as
an
Athletic
,
he
posted
various
career
highs
and
his
ERA
(
3.09
)
and
opponents
batting
average
were
the
lowest
of
his
career
.

His
inherited
runners
to
score
was
20
percent
which
ranked
fourth
lowest
in
the
American
League
.

In
2007
,
Gaudin
was
converted
into
a
starter
again
when
veteran
Esteban
Loaiza
was
on
the
disabled
list
to
begin
the
season
.

His
excellent
performance
as
a
starter
in

Chamicuro
is
a
critically
endangered
indigenous
American
language
spoken
by
just

pair

aboriginal
people
in
South
America

The
language
is
of
the
Chamicuro
people
who
number
between
10
and
20
.

The
Chamicuros
live
on
a
tributary
of
the
Huallaga
river
,
in
Perú
,
in
an
area
called
Pampa
Hermosa
,
meaning
beautiful
plains
.

As
with
all
native
languages
in
Perú
,
Chamicuro
is
by
default
an
official
language
in
the
area
in
which
it
is
spoken
.

A
Chamicuro
dictionary
has
been
created
,
however
no
children
can
speak
the
language
as
they
have
shifted
to
Spanish
.

There
is
controversy
in
regard
to
whether
Aguano
is
the
same
language
,
which
one
study
(
Ruhlen
1987
)
says
it
is
,
but
the
Chamicuros
dispute
this
(
Wise
,
1987
)
,
although
this
may
be
for
cultural
reasons
and
the
languages
may
actually
be
intelligible
but
the
different
peoples
do
not
relate
to
one
another
and
maintain
different
names
and
connotations
between
their

Christopher
Bailey
is
a
lecturer
of
English
at
the
University
of
Brighton
and
is
an
occasional
screenwriter
for
television
.

He
wrote
the
script
for
the
Doctor
Who
serial
Kinda
in
1982
.

This
script
drew
heavily
on
his
own
Buddhist
faith
and
incorporated
classic
Buddhist
terms
such
as
dukkha
,
panna
,
karuna
,
devaloka
and
Mara
---
indeed
,
"
the
Mara
"
was
the
name
of
the
villain
of
the
piece
.

The
strength
of
his
script
led
to
Bailey
writing
a
second
story
for
Doctor
Who
in
1983
.

This
serial
,
Snakedance
,
was
a
sequel
to
Kinda
.

New

neither
the
submitted
outlines

Christopher
Penley
(
born
circa
1990

was
a
15-year-old
U.S.
schoolboy
who
was
shot
by
a
SWAT
team
on
January
13
,
2006
---
and
died
of
his
injuries
---
after
he
had
briefly
taken
another
student
hostage
in
a
classroom
and
then
later
holed
himself
up
in
an
outdoor
bathroom
at
Milwee
Middle
School
in
Longwood
,
Florida
,
with
an
Airsoft
gun
painted
entirely
black
to
disguise
it
as
a
Beretta
9mm
.

After
the
gun
was
discovered
by
a
fellow
student
,
he
forced
the
student
into
the
closet
and
shut
off
the
lights
in
the
classroom
.

The
student
immediately
fled
and
informed
security
,
who
called
the
police
.

SWAT
arrived
on
the
scene
shortly
thereafter
,
while
a
negotiator
attempted
to
initiate
contact
with
Penley
.

After
a
twenty
minute
stand-off
he
aimed
the
pistol
at
Lieutenant
Michael
Weippert
,
who
responded
by
opening
fire
.

He
was
transported
to
Orlando
Regional
Medical
Center
where
he
remained
on
life
support
for
two
days
before
succumbing
to
his
wounds
.

A
number
of
his
organs
were
removed
and
used
as
transplants
.

Seminole
County
Sheriff
Don
Eslinger
said
the
boy
was
suicidal
and
would
not
respond
to
negotiators
who
tried
to
talk
him
down
in
the
bathroom
.

Some
students
at
the
school
told
the
media
after
the
incident
that
they
knew
he
had
"
something
planned
"
.

Police
have
been
criticized
for
initiating
action
instead
of
waiting
for
Penley
's
father
to
arrive
so
that
his
father
might
talk
him
out
of
the
situation
.

The
Orlando
Sentinel
reported
that
Ralph
Penley
was
not
told
of
events
until
after
his
son
was
shot
.

The
Florida
Department
of
Law
Enforcement
investigated
the
shooting
and
found
it
entirely
justified
,
as
Penley
pointed
a
weapon
at
the
deputy
.

Christopher

organs
were
donated
by

Circuit
Park
Zandvoort
is
a
motorsport
race
track
located
in
the
dunes
near
the
town
of
Zandvoort
,
in
the
Netherlands
,
near
the
North
Sea
coast
line
.

Although
there
were
plans
for
races
at
Zandvoort
before
World
War
II
,
the
first
street
race
was
held
on
June
3
,
1939
.

A
real
circuit
was
not
built
until
after
the
war
,
mainly
designed
by
John
Hugenholtz
.

The
circuit
was
inaugurated
on
August
,
7
,
1948
.

Next
year
,
in
1949
the
circuit
hosted
the
Zandvoort
Grand
Prix
.

It
remained
on
the
F1
calendar
for
30
out
of
the
next
34
years
.

The
company
that
commercially
ran
the
circuit
(
CENAV
)
went
out
of
business
,
marking
the
end
of
Circuit
Zandvoort
.

The
track
,
owned
by
the
municipality
of
Zandvoort
,
was
not
used
for
some
time
and
part
of
the
grounds
and
approximately
half
of
the
track
was
sold
in
1987
to
Vendorado
,
a
Bungalow
park
developer
at
that
time
.

A
plan
to
save
the
remaining
track
was
made
by
a
group
of
people
and
companies
.

In
1995
,
CPZ
got
the
"
A
Status
"
of
the
Dutch
government
and
began
building
an
international
Grand
Prix
Circuit
.

One
of
the
major
events
that
is
currently
held
at
the
circuit
,
along
with
DTM
and
A1GP
,
is
the
BP
Ultimate
Masters
of
Formula
3
,
where
Formula
3
cars
of
several
national
racing
series
compete
with
each
other
(
originally
called
Marlboro
Masters
,
before
tobacco
advertising
ban
)
.

The
most
famous
corner
in
the
circuit
is
the
Tarzanbocht
(
Tarzan
corner
)
which
provides
excellent
overtaking
opportunities
.

This
corner
is
reportedly
named
after
a
local
character
who
had
earned
the
nickname
of
Tarzan
and
only
wanted
to
give
up
his
vegetable
garden
in
the
dunes
if
the
track
's
designers
named
a
nearby
corner
after
him
.

On
the
other
hand
,
many
different
stories
about
Tarzan
Corner
are
known
.

Circuit

In

institution
with
research
programs
focusing
on
cancer
,
neurobiology
,
plant
genetics
,
genomics
and
bioinformatics
.

The
Laboratory
has
a
broad
educational
mission
,
including
the
recently
established
Watson
School
of
Biological
Sciences
.

Seven
Nobel
laureates
have
been
associated
with
the
lab
.

Though
the
lab
's
name
and
address
reference
the
town
"
Cold
Spring
Harbor
"
located
in
Suffolk
County
,
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
its
headquarters
are
in
fact
physically
located
in
the
adjacent
Nassau
County
village
of
Laurel
Hollow
..

The
laboratory
began
its
history
in
1890
as
an
extension
of
the
Brooklyn
Institute
of
Arts
and
Sciences
;
in
1904
,
the
Carnegie
Institution
of
Washington
established
the
Station
for
Experimental
Evolution
at
Cold
Spring
Harbor
on
the
site
.

In
1921
,
the
station
was
reorganized
as
the
Carnegie
Institution
Department
of
Genetics
.

The
Carnegie
Institution
Department
of
Genetics
scientists
at
Cold
Spring
Harbor
made
innumerable
contributions
to
the
sciences
of
genetics
,
medicine
,
and
the
then-infant
science
of
molecular
biology
,
and
in
1962
its
facilities
merged
with
those
of
The
Brooklyn
Institute
's
Biological
Laboratory
to
create
what
is
known
today
as
Cold
Spring
Harbor
Laboratory
.

In
1944
Barbara
McClintock
discovered
at
CSHL
transposons
(
"
jumping
genes
"
)
,
for
which
she
received
the
1983
Nobel
Prize
in
Physiology
or
Medicine
.

One
well-known
aspect
of
the
Laboratory
is
its
hosting
of
the
experiments
of
Alfred
Hershey
and
Martha
Chase
,
and
the
work
of
Max
Delbrüc
and
Salvado
Luria
.

Another
Nobel
laureate
scientist
there
was
Richard
J.
Roberts
.

Nobel
laureate
James
D.
Watson
(
who
co-discovered
the
double
helix
structure
of
DNA
with
Francis
Crick
)
served
as
the
Laboratory
's
Director
and
President
for
35
years
,
and
later
assumed
the
role
of
Chancellor
.

In
October
2007
Watson
resigned
as
a
result
of
controversial
remarks
about
race
made
to
The
Sunday
Times
in
the
U.K
.

Currently
,
cancer
biologist
Bruce
Stillman
serves
as
laboratory
President
.

During
the
years
1910
to
1940
,
the
laboratory
was
also
the
home
of
the
Eugenics
Record
Office
of
biologist
Charles
B.
Davenport
and
his
assistant
Harry
H.
Laughlin
,
two
prominent
American
eugenicists
of
the
period
.

In
1935
the
Carnegie
Institution
sent
a
team
to
review
their
work
,
and
as
a
result
the
ERO
was
ordered
to
stop
all
efforts
.

In
1939
the
Institute
withdrew
funding
for
the
ERO
entirely
,
leading
to
its
closure
.

Their
reports
,
articles
,
charts
,
and
pedigrees
were
considered
scientific
"
facts
"
in
their
day
,
but
have
since
been
discredited
.

However
,
this
closure
came
15
years
after
its
findings
were
incorporated
into
the
National
Origins
Act
(
Immigration
Act
of
1924
)
,
which
severely
reduced
the
number
of
immigrants
to
America
from
southern
and
eastern
Europe
who
,
Harry
Laughlin
testified
,
were
racially
inferior
than
the
Nordic
immigrants
from
England
and
Germany
.

Aside
from
its
scientific
mission
,
the
laboratory
is
host
to
world-class
scientific
conferences
on
a
variety
of
topics
.

The
first
of
the
annual
Cold
Spring
Harbor
Laboratory
Symposium
on
Quantitative
Biology
was
held
in
1934
.

The
Symposium
in
1960
,
Biological
Clocks
,
was
arguably
the
founding
moment
of
the
field
of
chronobiology
.

Now
,
over
24
meetings
,
in
addition
to
the
Symposium
,
for
between
200
and
500
scientists
,
are
held
annually
.

The
Banbury
Center
is
a
small
conference
center
that
holds
discussion-style
meetings
for
only
36
invited
participants
.

These
elite
meetings
cover
often
controversial
topics
in
molecular
biology
and
neuroscience
.

Salvador
Luria
and
Max
Delbrüc
founded
the
Phage
Course
in
1948
,
a
course
that
trained
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
new
field
of
molecular
genetics
.

The
courses
proliferated
under
Watson
's
guidance
and
each
year
some
28
advanced
courses
are
held
for
graduate
students
and
postdoctoral
fellows
who
travel
to
CSHL
from
throughout
the
world
.

The
laboratory
also
offers
many
programs
for
students
in
high
school
and
college
in
biotechnology
and
biology
.

The
lab
is
particularly
well
known
for
its
contributions
towards
the
training
of
young
scientists
,
notably
through
the
establishment
of
its
Undergraduate
Research
Program
in
1959
,
its
Dolan
DNA
Learning
Center
in
1988
,
and

to
be
an
unpopular
"
wild
card
"
version
in
1998
.

The
name
was
changed
to
"
Classic
Lotto
"
,
and
the
wild
card
ball
disappeared
,
in
May
1999

The
current
game
(
as
of
2007
)
pays
winners
$2
for
matching
three
numbers
,
with
parimutuel
prizes
for
matching
more
numbers
.

The
jackpot
is
won
if
all
six
match
.

Top-prize
winners
choose
lump
sum
or
annuity
within
60
days
of
claiming
the
jackpot
.

In
the
unlikely
event
that
the
annuity
is
chosen
,
the
prize
is
paid
in
21
yearly
installments
.

The
overall
prize
pool
is
52%
of

half
of

alone

As
with
all
Connecticut
Lottery
games
,
the
minimum
age
to
play
Classic
Lotto
is
18
.

The
Classic
Lotto
jackpot
was
most
recently
hit
on
June
8
,
2007
;
the
jackpot
is
almost
never
shared
by
two
or
more
tickets
.

Winners
of
Classic
Lotto
(
jackpot
or
otherwise
)
have
one
year
to
claim
their
prizes
.

A
Classic
Lotto
jackpot
of
$3.5
million
(
annuity
)
on
a
ticket
bought
in
February
2006
went
unclaimed
.

The
Connecticut
Lottery
had
several
options
for
distributing
the
$2.1
million
cash
that
would
have
funded
the
jackpot
prize
;
as
of
June
2007
,
there
has
been
no
official
word
as
to
what
the
money
will
be
used
for
.

It
is
possible
the
money
will
go
into
future
Classic
Lotto
drawings
;
for
a
time
in
the
mid-to-late
1990s
,
unclaimed
jackpot
cash
was
used
to
guarantee
starting
jackpots
of
$2
million
,
instead
of
the
usual
$1
million
.

Since
Connecticut
is
a
member
of
the
Multi-State
Lottery
Association
(
MUSL
)
,
it
is
eligible
to
offer
its
other
multi-state
games
.

One
of
these
is
the
annuitized
jackpot
game
Hot
Lotto
,
played
the
same
as
its
flagship
game
Powerball
;
however
,
Connecticut
is

to
continue

into
at

In

co-authored

with

a
senior
fellow
of
the
Discovery
Institute
's
Center
for
Science
and
Culture
,
in
the
scientific
journal
Protein
Science
,
which
received
widespread
criticism
.

Behe
has
stated
that
the
results
of
the
paper
support
his
notion
of
irreducible
complexity
,
based
on
the
calculation
of
the
probability
of

Michael

On

,
Behe
described
the
paper
in
presenting
arguments
for
irreducible
complexity

his
testimony
at

hearings

At

trial
later
that

it
was
the
one
article
referenced
by
both
Behe

Scott
Minnich
as
supporting
intelligent
design
.

In
his
ruling
,
Judge
Jones
noted
that
"
A
review
of
the
article
indicates
that
it
does
not
mention
either
irreducible
complexity
or
ID
.

In
fact
,
Professor
Behe
admitted
that
the
study
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
article
did
not
rule
out
many
known
evolutionary
mechanisms
and
that
the
research
actually
might
support
evolutionary
pathways
if
a
biologically
realistic
population
size
were

August
30
,
1963
in
Waikabubak
)
is
an
Indonesian
guitarist
,
songwriter
and
composer
.

He
is
the
lead
guitarist
and
songwriter
of
the
band
Gigi
.

Budjana
's
style
changed
dramatically
to
jazz
as
he
got
to
know
John
McLaughlin
,
Pat
Metheny
,
Jeff
Beck
,
John
Abercrombie
,
Chick
Corea
and
Weather
Report
.

In
his
early
experience
,
he
established
a
band
called
"
Squirrell
"
which
was
popular
in
the
local
community
.

Throughout
his
musical
experience
in
Indonesia
,
Dewa
Budjana
has
collaborated
with
many
famous
guitarists
such
as
Tohpati
,
Ridho
and
Abdee
Negara
.

His
ability
to
combine
jazz
and
rock
has
put
him
among
the
top
Indonesian
guitarists
.

Budjana
's
passion
and
talent
in
music
,
especially
guitar
,
has
been
very
dominant
since
he
was
in
an
elementary
school
in
Klungkung
,
Bali
.

Budjana
's
first
teacher
was
a
construction
worker
who
lived
nearby
.

He
stole
money
from
his
grandmother
to
buy
his
first
guitarHe
prioritised
guitar
in
his
life
,
and
started
to
teach
himself
by
playing
rock
songs
.

He
became
more
passionate
about
music
,
and
was
reflected
when
Budjana
moved
to
Surabaya
,
East
Java
,
where
he
took
a
classical
music
course
,
performed
with
a
band
and
participated
in
many
of
music
performances
.

After
graduation
,
he
went
to
Jakarta
to
pursue
a
career
as
professional
musician
.

While
there
,
he
came
across
Jack
Lesmana
,
a
jazz
maestro
and
father
of
jazz
musician
Indra
Lesmana
,
who
taught
Budjana
the
philosophy
of
jazz
.

In
1976
,
when
he
was
thirteen
,
Budjana
's
name
started
to
be

in
the
music
world
in
Surabaya
.

Later
,
in
1981
,
he
bought
a
"
real
"
electric
guitar
(
an
Aria
Pro
II
)
and
started
to
play
with
many
different
people
.

Slowly
,
his
musical
style
changed
from
pop
rock
to
jazz
,
as
he
started
to
incorporate
influences
from
John
McLaughlin
of
the
Mahavishnu
Orchestra
,
Chick
Corea
,
Yes
,
Gentle
Giant
,
Kansas
,
Tangerine
Dream
,
American
Garage
,
Bright
Size
Life
,
Pat
Metheny
and
Allan
Holdsworth
.

In
1980
,
Budjana
started
Squirrel
,
his
first
jazz
band
,
with
his
schoolmates
in
Surabaya
.

Squirrel
participated
in
a
number
of
national
music
events
,
including
Light
Music
Contest
in
1984
at
Teater
Terbuka
,
TIM
,
Indonesia
.

Though
many
contestants
participated
,
it
was
Budjana
and
his
fellow
bandmates
who
outperformed
the
competition
and
won
.

One
year
after
that
,
Budjana
decided
to
fly
to
Jakarta
in
order
to
expand
his
music
career
.

This
journey
lead
him
to
Jack
Lesmana
,
an
Indonesian
jazz
legend
,
who
introduced
him
to
other
professional
musicians
.

Although
Jack
provided
Budjana
with
opportunities
in
his
Indonesian
music
career
,
it
was
Indra
who
first
asked
him
to
became
a
session
player
.

A
few
years
later
,
Budjana
joined
the
band
Spirit
,
which
included
Baron
,
Gigi
's
former
guitarist
.

With
Budjana
,
Spirit
released
one
self-titled
album
,
before
Budjana
decided
to
leave
the
band
and
joined
Java
Jazz
.

He
also
sat
in
with
many
other
bands
---
including
the
Jimmy
Manopo
Band
,
Erwin
Gutawa
,
Elfa
's
Big
Band

---
and
participated
in
the
North
Sea
Jazz
Festival
,
a
world
jazz
convention
in
Den
Haag
,
the
Netherlands
.

His
current
band
,

,
was
formed
in
1994
with
Baron
(
guitar
)
,
Thomas
(
bass
)
,
Armand
(
vocal
)
and
Ronald
(
drum

.

Since
then
,

also
released
his
own
solo
albums
:
Nusa
Damai
;
Gitarku
;
Samsara
;
and
Home
,
a
tribute
album
to
the
December
2004
tsunami
victims
.

Since
Dewa
Budjana
started
his
professional
career
as
a
musician
,
he
has
mainly
used
a
Parker
Fly
Delux
as
his
main
guitar
,
occasionally
using

SG
series
instead
.

Budjana
also

Diego
Silang
y
Andaya
(
December
16
,
1730
-
May
28
,
1763
)
was
raised
as
an
Ilocano
;
his
father
was
Pangasinense
.

He
was
a
revolutionary
leader
who
conspired
with
British
forces
to
overthrow
the
Spanish
in
the
northern
Philippines
and
establish
an
independent
Ilocano
nation
.

His
revolt
was
fueled
by
grievances
stemming
from
Spanish
tributes
and
abuses
,
and
his
belief
in
self-government
,
that
the
administration
and
leadership
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
and
government
in
the
Ilocos
Region
(
which
at
this
time
did
not
include
Pangasinan
)
should
be
led
by
trained
Ilocano
officials
.

Born
in
Aringay
,
Pangasinan
(
an
area
in
present-day
Caba
or
Aringay
,
La
Union
)
,
he
worked
as
a
messenger
for
a
local
Castilian
priest
in
Vigan
,
Ilocos
Sur
.

Bright
,
passionate
and
fluent
in
Spanish
,
he
ferried
correspondence
from
the
Ilocos
to
Manila
,
journeys
that
gave
him
his
first
glimpse
of
colonial
injustice
and
that
planted
the
seeds
of
rebellion
.

Spain
allied
with
France
during
the
Seven
Years
'
War
against
Great
Britain
.

In
so
doing
,
the
British
sought
to
diminish
the
Spanish
Empire
.

British
naval
forces
took
over
Manila
in
October
1762
,
that
inspired
uprisings
in
the
farthest
north
of
Ilocos
Norte
and
Cagayan
,
where
anti-Spanish
sentiments
festered
.

While
Silang
initially
wanted
to
replace
Spanish
functionaries
in
the
Ilocos
with
native
officials
,
and
volunteered
to
head
Ilocano
forces
against
the
British
,
desperate
Spanish
administrators
transferred
their
powers
to
the
Catholic
Bishop
of
Nueva
Segovia
(
Vigan
)
who
in
turn
rejected
Silang
's
call
.

Silang
's
group
attacked
the
city
and
imprisoned
its
priests
.

He
then
began
an
association
with
the
British
who
appointed
him
governor
of
the
Ilocos
on
their
behalf
and
promised
him
military
reinforcement
.

The
British
force
never
materialized
.

He
was
killed
by
one
of
his
friends
,
a
Spanish-Ilocano
mestizo
named
Miguel
Vicos
who
was
paid
by
church
authorities
to
assassinate
him
.

After
Diego
Silang
's
death
,
his
wife
,
Josefa
Gabriela
,
took
over
the
revolt
and
fought
courageously
.

A
strong
force
was
sent
against
her
.

She
was
forced
to
retreat
to
Abra
.

Riding
a
fast
horse
,
Gabriela
led
her
troops
towards
Vigan
,
but
she
was
driven
back
.

She
fled
again
to
Abra
,
where
she
was
captured
.

On
September
20
,
1763
,
she
and
about
100
followers
were
executed
by
the
Spanish
authorities
.

Digilogue

a
music
album
of
recordings
which
became
the
twentieth
commercial
release
by
the
British
avant-garde
music
group
:
zoviet*france
:
.

It
was
first
released
in
1996
in
limited
edition
12
inch
clear
vinyl
album
format
by
the
US
record
label

Soleilmoon
Recordings
.

Subsequently
,
a
CD
version
was
released
in
1998
by
Soleilmoon
Recordings
,
with
additional
tracks
.

The
album
's
title
is
an
amalgamation
of
the
words
'
digital
'
and
'
analogue
'
,
two
of
the
principal
technologies
that
have
been
used
in
sound
recording
.

The
group
have
been
quoted
as
adopting
the
failings
in
these
technologies
as
a
production
technique
in
the
creation
of
the
album
:
"
All
audio
equipment
distorts
sound
to
some
degree
and
,
eventually
through
mechanical
and
electrical
failure
,
fucks
it
up
.

Since
indeterminacy
as
a
compositional
parameter
has
been
a
constant
in
our
work
,
this
often
produces
what
we
regard
as
interesting
new
developments
.

digilogue
was
recorded
using
a
mixture
of
failing
analogue
equipment
and
high-end
digital
equipment
,
and
monitored
in
our
studio
exclusively
on
damaged
hi-fi
speakers
.

Sound
can
be
as
dirty
and
as
clumsy
as
anything
else
we
perceive
with
our
senses
.

This
is
just
as
true
of
sound
generated
in
the
digital
domain
,
much
as
we
would
all
like
to
believe
the
claims
of
near-perfection
made
by
audio
equipment
manufacturers
.
"

"
We
were
using
digital
equipment
to
produce
the
music
but
in
a
very
analogue
way

We
were
using
sampling
processes

in

north-west
,
in
the
village
of
Vanxim
.

The
Konkan
Railway
passes
through
the
village
and
the
nearest
stop
to
the
village
is
the
train
station
at
Karmali
.

The
drive
to
the
village
is
scenic
,
with
paddy
fields
and
wooded
hills
lacing
the
roadway
,
very
typical
of
the
Goan
countryside
.

Though
in
a
manner
equally
typical
of
modern
Goa
,
of
late
the
paddy
fields
lie
fallow
and
overrun
with
weeds
.

The
Island
of
Divar
was
a
famous
site
of
Hindu
pilgrimage
and
hosted
the
the
ancient
temples
of
Shree
Saptakoteshwar
,
Shree
Ganesh
and
Shree
Dwarkeshwar
besides
others
.

These
were
irreversibly
destroyed
by
Portuguese
zealots
in
the
16th
century
in
their
drive
for
Christianisation
of
Goa
.

The
ancient
site
of
Hindu
pilgrimage
is
called
Porne
Tirth
(
Old
pilgrim
spot-in
Konkani
)
even
today
.

Rui
Gomez
Pereira
in
his
book
Goan
temples
and
deities
writes
,
"
The
original
temple
(
Of
Shree
Saptakoteshwar
)
was
constructed
in
the
12th
century
by
the
kings
of
Kadamba
dynasty
.

Shree
Saptakoteshwar
was
the
patron
Deity
of
the
Kadambas
.

It
was
destroyed
by
the
sultan
of
the
Deccan
in
the
middle
of
the
14th
century
and
reconstructed
at
the
same
locality
by
Madhav
Mantri
of
Vijaynagar
at
the
close
of
the
same
century
.

It
was
again
destroyed
by
the
Portuguese
in
1540
.
"

The
Saptakoteshwar
idol
was
shifted
to
Narve
in
Bicholim
after
the
destruction
of
the
temple
by
the
Portuguese
.

The
present
temple
in
Narve
,
Bicholim
was
rebuilt
by
ShivajiRaje
Bhonsale
the
Great
Maratha
leader
.

A
Jesuit
priest
Fr
Francisco
Sousa
documented
the
religious
importance
of
"
Divar
"
in
his
book
Oriente
Conquistado
(
Conquest
of
the
orient
)
around
the
latter
quarter
of
the
16th
or
early
17th
century
.

Fr.
Sousa
testifies
that
"
Divar
was
as
much
venerated
by
the
Hindu
Brahmins
as
the
Holy
land
by
us
,
on
account
of
a
temple
of
many
indulgences
and
pilgrimages.
..
"
Rui
Gomez
Pereira
details
further
stating
,
"
The
linga
of
the
temple
,
made
of
five
metals
-
gold
,
silver
,
copper
,
iron
and
bronze
"
was
later
relocated
in
Bicholim
.

And
on
the
foundations
of
the
same
temple
a
prayer
and
catechism
house
was
constructed
in
1563
,
which
was
later
transformed
into
the
chapel
of
Our
Lady
of
Cande
laria
.
"

The
original
inhabitants
of
this
island
were
people
who
once
lived
in
Old
Goa
but
had
to
desert
during
a
disastrous
pest
that
greatly
reduced
the
population
of
Old
Goa
.

Piedade
,
a
small
village
is
spread
at
the
bottom
of
a
small
forested
hillock
on
which
there
is
the
Church
of
Our
Lady
of
Compassion
.

The
island
is
dotted
with
well
maintained
,
elegant
Portuguese
villas
.

From
the
top
of
the
hill
,
superb
panoramic
views
of
the
surrounding
countryside
,
including
Old
Goa
,
the
capital
of
Goa
,
Panaji
,
the
meandering
Mandovi
river
,
and
the
bridges
across
it
can
be
seen
.

The
famous
Bonderam
festival
is
celebrated
in
Divar
on
the
fourth
Saturday
of
August
during
the
monsoon
with
great
fanfare
and
attended
by
thousands
of
tourists
and
locals
.

Bonderam
Festival
:
The
festival
is
a
memoir
to
the
dispute
and
the
fury
of
the
Villagers
over
the
Portuguese
system
of
resolving
the
disputes
.

The
villagers
on
the
Divar
Island
often
indulged
in
some
kind
of
fight
over
the
matter
of
ownership
of
their
lands
.

To
stop
the
disputes
the
Portuguese
,
put
up
flags
at
the
boundaries
.

The
villagers
did
not
like
this
system
.

So
they
protested
against
the
Portuguese
by
throwing
stones
at
the
flags
.

On
this
day
a
carnival
ambience
is
created
.

Each
section
of
the
village
has
a
float
at
the
parade
.

Melodious
music
could
be
heard
throughout
the
village
.

The
gaily
colored
floats
accompanied
by
colorfully
dressed
youngsters
make
a
pretty
picture
.

The
huge
bell
which
today
adorns
the
Se
Cathedral
in
Old
Goa
was
originally
donated
by
the
master
of
a
sinking
ship
who
'd
made
a
vow
that
,
were
he
to
survive
his
fate
,
he
would
donate
the
ship
's
bell
to
the
first
church
village
,
town
,
or
city
his
vessel
touched
.

It
so
happened
that
that
island
was
Divar
.

In
keeping
with
his
promise
,
he
donated
the
bell
to
the
church
of
Divar
,
which
is
located
on
a
high
hillock
.

Unfortunately
though
,
every
time
the
bell
was
struck
,
it
shattered
the
windows
of
the
church
and
the
houses
in
the
vicinity
,
so
a
deal
was
struck
and
the
bell
was
exchanged
with
that
of
the
Se
Cathedral
.

Dorothea
von
Schlegel
(
née
Brende
Mendelssohn
)
(
October
24
1764
-
August
3
1839
)
was
a
German
novelist
and
translator
.

Dorothea
von
Schlegel
was
born
in
1764
in
Berlin
[1
]
.

Oldest
daughter
of
the
philosopher
Moses
Mendelssohn
,
a
leading
figure
in
the
German
Enlightenment
(
Aufklarung
)
.

She
married
the
merchant
and
banker
Simon
Veit
in
1783
.

Their
son
,
Philipp
Veit
,
would
later
become
part
of
a
circle
of
German
Christian
painters
called
"
the
Nazarenes
,
"
who
influenced
the
later
English
painters
in
the
Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood
.

She
met
the
poet
and
critic
Friedrich
von
Schlegel
in
the
salon
of
her
friend
Henriette
Herz
,
after
which
she
left
her
husband
.

They
were
divorced
in
1799
.

She
obtained
custody
of
her
younger
son
,
Phillip
,
and
lived
with
him
at
the
Ziegelstraße
,
which
became
a
salon
frequented
by
Tieck
,
Schelling
,
the
Schlegel
brothers
,
and
Novalis
.

Schlegel
's
novel
"
Lucinde
"
(
1799
)
was
seen
as
an
account
of
their
affair
,
causing
a
scandal
in
German
literary
circles
.

In
1801
her
novel
"
Florentin
"
was
published
anonymously
by
Schlegel
.

They
lived
in
Paris
from
1802
until
1804
,
and
after
her
divorce
they
married
as
Protestants
.

In
1807lt
she
translated
"
Corinne
"
by
Madame
de
Staë
from
the
French
.

In
1808
,
Friedrich
and
Dorothea
converted
to
Catholicism
.

(
She
may
have
adopted
the
name
"
Dorothea
"
from
a
17th
century
Dorothea
von
Schlegel
who
composed
Catholic
hymns
)
.

They
continued
to
visit
the
salons
of
Rahel
Levin
and
Henriette
Herz
,
as
well
as
the
constellation
which
surrounded
Madame
de
Staë
.

Friedrich
died
in
1829
,
after
which
she
moved
to
Frankfurt
am
Main
.

There
,
she
lived
with
her
son
Philipp
(
also
a
convert
to
a
medieval
style
of
Catholicism
)
until
her
death
in
1839
.

Since
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
greatest
Jewish
philosopher
of
the
Enlightenment
-
Moses
Mendelssohn
-
(
of
equal
stature
with
Immanuel
Kant
,
and
translator
of
John
Locke
and
Alexander
Pope
,
as
well
as
Hebrew
scriptures
into
German
)
,
Dorothea
was
surrounded
throughout
her
life
by
the
leading
poets
,
critics
,
musicians
,
novelists
,
and
philosophers
of
Europe
.

Gotthold
Ephraim
Lessing
was
her
father
's
closest
friend
and
colleague
,
and
the
Emancipation
and
secularization
of
the
Jews
and
Jewish
culture
was
a
direct
outcome
of
their
work
.

(
Mendelssohn
was
the
model
for
Nathan
der
Weise
in
Lessing
's
play
of
the
same
name
.
)

Friedrich
the
Great
was
Lessing
's
patron
,
and
he
extended
royal
protection
and
sponsorship
to
Mendelssohn
,
as
well
.

Dorothea
's
brother
,
Joseph
,
was
a
friend
and
sponsor
of
Alexander
von
Humboldt
,
the
great
naturalist
and
ethnologist
.

Her
nephew
was
Felix
Mendelssohn
,
the
composer
,
who
with
his
sister
,
Fanny
,
were
considered
nearly
the
equals
of
the
Mozarts
as
child
prodigies
.

To
fully
appreciate
the
importance
of
this
cultural
scene
,
see
the
entries
for
Moses
Mendelssohn
,
Gotthold
Ephraim
Lessing
,
Friedrich
Schlegel
,
Germaine
de
Staë
,
Felix
Mendelssohn
,
Ludwi
Tieck
,
Novalis
,
and
others
.

Dorothea
was
the
common
link
or
nexus
among
them
all
.

Most
of
her
work
,
letters
,
biographies
,
etc.
seem
to
be
available
only
in
German
.

And
there
,
with
the
legacy
of
the
Holocaust
,
she
would
seem
to
have
an
ambiguous
status
.

The
emancipation
of
European
Jewry
,
in
which
she
and
her
family
played
the
greatest
imaginable
role
,
became
the
main
target
of
the
Third
Reich
and
its
Nuremberg
Laws
.

For
some
Jews
,
she
may
be
a
less
than
admirable
figure
as
well
,
having
left
her
Jewish
husband
,
violated
her
divorce
settlement
,
and
converted
first
to
Protestantism
(
which
was
favorable
towards
Judaism
)
,
and
finally
to
Catholicism
(
which
was
not
)
.

Most
of
her
later
friends
were
Christians
,
assimilated
or
intermarried
Jews
(
like
Rahel
Levin
)
,
or
secular
Deists
and
materialists
.

Her
association
with
Germaine
de
Staë
was
obviously
of
the
greatest
importance
,
since
she
was
also
the
patron
and
literary
companion
of
Dorothea
's
second
husband
,
Friedrich
Schlegel
.

De
Staë
was
the
daughter
of
Jacques
Necker
,
Louis
XVI
's
finance
minister
,
and
a
leading
figure
in
the
collapse
of
the
Bourbons
and
the
French
Revolution
.

(
See
Christopher
Herrold
's
"
Mistress
to
an
Age
.
"
)

It
was
probably
through
de
Staë
's
husband
,
a
Swedish
Count
,
that
the
Schlegel
's
were
granted
a
title
of
nobility
in
the
Swedish
court
.

In
older
literature
and
on
her
gravestone
one
finds
the
date
1763

of
her

Duane
Bobick
(
born
24
August
,
1950
in
Little
Falls
,
Minnesota
)
was
a
boxer
from
the
United
States
,
who
became
world
amateur
heavyweight
champion
in
1971
,
and
also
won
the
gold
medal
at
the
1971
Pan
American
Games
.

He
fought
for
the
United
States
at
the
1972
Summer
Olympics
in
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
and
later
contended
for
the
world
heavyweight
belt
during
the
division
's
most
highly
rated
era
.

Bobick
's
younger
brother
Rodney
Bobick
was
also
a
heavyweight
boxer
,
though
less
successful
,
and
died
in
a
single
car
crash
in
1977
.

Six
foot
,
three
inches
tall
and
215
pounds
in
his
prime
,
Bobick
was
part
of
a
boxing
family
and
grew
up
with
the
sport
in
the
1960s
.

A
tremendous
puncher
who
developed
well
early
by
virtue
of
countless
hours
in
the
gym
and
ring
,
Bobick
had
an
outstanding
amateur
career
that
included
a
win
over
Cuba
's
famous
Teófil
Stevenson
at
the
197
Pan
American
Games
.

Bobick
added
another
future
champion
to
his
list
when
he
beat
Larry
Holmes
to
be
named
to
the
1972
U.S.
Olympic
boxing
team
for
the
Munich
Olympics
.

Bobick
was
rated
a
star
at
this
early
stage
,
and
may
have
been
very
overconfident
as
he
met
Stevenson
again
during
the
Olympic
trials
.

Despite
Bobick
winning
the
second
round
,
Stevenson
knocked
Bobick
down
in
the
third
and
the
contest
was
stopped
.

Bobick
trained
hard
to
start
his
pro
career
,
which
did
not
begin
until
the
following
spring
,
1973
.

Bobick
trained
with
and
was
managed
by
heavyweight
legend
Joe
Frazier
.

Bobick
's
first
match
was
against
Tommy
Burns
.

He
sent
Burns
to
the
canvas
four
times
on
his
way
to
a
first-round
KO
.

Bobick
had
14
other
fights
in
1973
,
winning
them
all
by
KO
,
including
a
win
over
former
contender
Manuel
Ramos
.

Bobick
won
his
first
19
fights
by
knockout
.

He
had
10
more
fights
in
1974
,
winning
them
all
again
,
eight
by
KO
.

Knockout
wins
that
year
included
Ted
Gullick
and
future
champion
Mike
Weaver
.

He
also
decisioned
veteran
boxer
Billy
Daniels
.

Bobick
was
now
25-0
with
23
KOs
.

He
was
then
rated
by
many
to
be
the
sport
's
new
"
White
Hope
,
"
taking
that
label
from
then-declining
Jerry
Quarry
.

Frazier
himself
was
approaching
retirement
and
focusing
on
upcoming
paydays
with
protege
Bobick
.

Bobick
gained
top-10
ranking
in
1975
with
eight
more
fights
and
wins
,
all
again
by
KO
.

He
was
now
being
dodged
by
some
,
but
a
win
over
Randy
Neumann
proved
he
could
not
be
ignored
.

He
had
a
tentative
contract
with
Muhammed
Ali
in
1976
,
but
the
fight
never
materialized
.

Instead
he
met
and
defeated
Larry
Middleton
,
fellow
Minnesotan
Scott
LeDoux
,
Bunny
Johnson
and
Chuck
Wepner
among
his
five
1976
fights
,
all
wins
with
two
KOs
.

Bobick
had
now
improved
enough
as
a
boxer
to
be
a
legitimate
title
threat
.

He
took
a
38-0
record
with
34
KO
's
into
the
ring
against
powerful
former
champion
Ken
Norton
in
May
1977
.

The
two
punchers
went
right
after
each
other
.

Norton
connected
first
and
very
hard
.

Following
up
on
the
staggered
Bobick
,
Norton
also
landed
a
hard
punch
to
Bobick
's
windpipe
but
was
never
penalized
.

The
fight
lasted
just
one
minute
before
Bobick
was
counted
out
.

Bobick
was
widely
criticized
after
the
Norton
match
and
dismissed
by
many
.

Saturday
Night
Live
made
fun
of
Bobick
by
showing
footage
of
his
Nationally
televised
knockout
loss
,
over
and
over
again
.

Despite
that
,
he
was
back
in
the
ring
two
months
later
,
winning
a
rematch
with
Scott
LeDoux
.

He
finished
the
year
1977
40-1
with
36
KO's
.

In
1978
,
he
was
upset
by
South
African
puncher
Kallie
Knoetze
for
his
second
KO
loss
.

He
fought
eight
more
times
against
second-tier
fighters
in
1978
,
winning
all
by
KO
.

He
was
looking
to
return
to
top-level
contention
in
1979
when
he
was
KO
'd
by
future
beltholder
John
Tate
.

Another
KO
loss
to
George
Chaplin
that
year
led
to
an
announcement
of
retirement
.

His
pro
record
was
48-4
with
42
KOs
with
wins
over
several
notable
contenders
.

All
four
of
his
pro
losses
were
by
KO
.

Bobick
returned
to
Minnesota
and
took
heavy
industry
work
before
a
machine
accident
nearly
killed
him
in
1997
.

After
that
he
went
into
coaching
and
public
speaking
,
using
his
still-present
celebrity
to
encourage
and
help
others
.

In
November
2006
,

Eduard
Hitzig
(
February
6
,
1839
-
August
20
,
1907
)
was
a
German
neuropsychiatrist
from
Berlin
.

He
studied
medicine
in
Berlin
and
Würzburg
.

He
had
as
instructors
,
famous
men
such
as
Emil
Du
Bois-Reymond
(
1818-1896
)
,
Rudolf
Virchow
(
1821-1902
)
,
Moritz
Heinrich
Romberg
(
1795-1873
)
and
Karl
Friedrich
Otto
Westphal
(
1833-1890
)
.

He
received
his
doctorate
in
1862
,
and
subsequently
practiced
medicine
in
Berlin
and
Würzburg
.

In
1875
he
became
director
of
the
Burghölzli
asylum
,
as
well
as
professor
of
psychiatry
at
the
University
of
Zurich
.

In
1885
Hitzig
became
a
professor
at
the
University
of
Halle
,
where
he
remained
until
his
retirement
in
1903
.

Hitzig
is
remembered
for
his
work
concerning
the
interaction
between
electrical
current
and
the
brain
.

In
1870
,
Hitzig
assisted
by
anatomist
Gustav
Fritsch
(
1837-1927
)
,
applied
electricity
via
a
thin
probe
to
the
exposed
cerebral
cortex
of
a
dog
without
anesthesia
.

They
performed
these
studies
at
the
home
of
Fritsch
because
the
University
of
Berlin
would
not
allow
such
experimentation
in
their
laboratories
.

What
Hitzig
and
Fritsch
had
discovered
is
that
electrical
stimulation
of
different
areas
of
the
cerebrum
caused
involuntary
muscular
contractions
of
specific
parts
of
the
dog
's
body
.

They
identified
the
brains
'
"
motor
strip
"
which
is
a
vertical
strip
of
brain
tissue
on
the
cerebrum
in
the
back
of
the
frontal
lobe
which
controls
different
muscles
in
the
body
.

In
1870
Hitzig
published
his
findings
in
an
essay
called
"
On
the
Electrical
Excitability
of
the
Cerebrum
"
.
This
experimentation
was
considered
the
first
time
anyone
had
done
any
"
localized
study
"
regarding
the
brain
and
electrical
current
.

However
this
was
not
the
first
time
Hitzig
had
experienced
the
interaction
between
the
brain
and
electricity
;
earlier
in
his
career
as
a
physician
working
with
the
Prussian
Army
he
experimented
on
wounded
soldiers
whose
skulls
were
fractured
by
bullets
.

Hitzig
noticed
that
applying
a
small
electrical
current
to
the
brains
of
these
soldiers
caused
involuntary
muscular
movement
.

Apparently
Hitzig
's
crude
experimentation
was
inspired
by
work
of
18th
century
physicist
Luigi
Galvani
who
noticed
this
same
electrical
phenomena
on
the
brains
of
frogs
.

Hitzig
and
Fritsch
's
work
opened
the
door
to
further
"
localized
testing
"
of
the
brain
by
many
others
including
Scottish
neurologist
,
David
Ferrier
.

title
is
Szomorú
Vasárnap
.

Although
the

a
romantic
love
triangle
with
tragic
consequences
,
it
has
a
strong
history
background
,
set
in
World
War
II
Hungary
.

The

song
Gloomy
Sunday
(
German
translation
:
Trauriger
Sonntag
)
is
at
first
loved
and
then
feared
by
the
public
,
for
its
melancholic
melody
triggers
off
a
chain
of
suicides
.

For
a
while
Ilona
lives
in
harmony
with
both
men
.

The
German
businessman
Hans
is
a
regular
patron
at
the
restaurant
;
equally
,
he
falls

.

He
tries
to
commit
suicide
by
jumping
into
a
river
,
but
László
saves
him
and
Hans
returns
to
Germany
.

After
a
few
years
Nazi
Germany
captures
Budapest
and
Hans
returns
.

He
is
now
an
SS
officer
and
responsible
for
organizing
the
transport
of
Budapest
's
Jews
to
the
concentration
camps
;
however
,
he
uses
his
position
to
save
the
wealthiest
Jews
(
and
allows
them
to
secretly
leave
German
Europe
)
in
exchange
for
large
"
gifts
"
of
goods
and
money
.

Ilona
does
all
she
can
to
save
László
from
deportation
,
but
Hans
is
punishing
her
for
his
past
rejection
.

The
Fairfax
Connector
is
a
public
bus
service
provided
by
Fairfax
County
,
Virginia
,
and
operated
by
Veolia
Transport
under
contract
.

The
first
buses
rolled
out
in
September
1985
as
a
lower-cost
alternative
to
the
Metrobus
service
of
the
regional
Washington
Metropolitan
Area
Transit
Authority
.

The
original
routes
connected
the
southern
part
of
the
county
(
near
the
Mount
Vernon
Estate
)
to
the
Huntington
Metrorail
Station
which
borders
Alexandria
.

This
area
continues
to
be
the
core
of
the
system
,
and
is
noted
for
the
number
of
residents
in
the
Richmond
Highway
area
who
use
the
service
at
all
times
of
the
day
.

The
Fairfax
Connector
,
or
simply
"
The
Connector
"
,
has
since
expanded
to
50-odd
routes
spanning
much
of
the
county
.

In
1994
,
the
service
was
extended
to
the
high-technology
industrial
areas
of
suburban
Reston
and
Herndon
,
located
between
Washington
,
D.C.
and
Washington
Dulles
International
Airport
.

Along
State
Route
267
(
the
Dulles
Toll
Road
)
,
express
buses
carry
commuters
from
free
park-and-ride
lots
to
the
Washington
Metro
system
.

Fares
are
paid
in
cash
(
exact
change
)
,
paper
bus
transfer
,
or
a
Metrobus
weekly
unlimited
bus
"

pass
.

Fairfax
Connector
deployed
SmarTrip
readers
on
its
buses
in
May
2007
,
extending
the
use
of
this
Washington
Metro
fare-payment
system
to
Fairfax
County
.

Base
fare
is
usually
$1
,
but
can
be
as
much
as
$3
for
express
routes
.

With
a
Metrorail
transfer
,
fares
are
discounted
to
$0.35
exact
change
from
$1
fares
,
and
$2.10
exact
change
for
$3
fares
.

Senior
citizens
receive
discounted
fares
(
either
$0.50
or
$1.00
)
on
all
buses
,
or
free
fare
with
a
Metrorail
transfer
.

Children
